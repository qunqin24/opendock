# opencode-auto-approval-plugin

An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) plugin that sends tool operations to a read-only AI reviewer
before automatically approving them.

By default the reviewer runs in its own OpenCode session. It may inspect the workspace with `read`,
`glob`, `grep`, and `lsp`, but cannot edit files, run shell commands, access the network, use MCP
tools, or start subagents. Alternatively, decisions can be delegated to the
[Jev](#jev-reviewer-backend) decision model over HTTP.

## Supported OpenCode versions

The package ships both plugin API generations in one default export, so the same version works on:

| OpenCode      | Plugin API                             | Config key |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 2.x           | V2 (`@opencode/plugin`, `setup()`)     | `plugins`  |
| 1.18.29 – 1.x | V1 (`@opencode-ai/plugin`, `server()`) | `plugin`   |

OpenCode releases before 1.18.29 only accept a bare function as the plugin export and cannot load
this package; use `opencode-auto-approval-plugin@0.1.x` there.

## Install

OpenCode installs npm plugins listed in its configuration automatically. Add the package to the
project or global OpenCode configuration.

OpenCode 2.x (`opencode.json`):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": ["opencode-auto-approval-plugin"],
}
```

OpenCode 1.x:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-auto-approval-plugin"],
}
```

For local development, build the package and place it under `.opencode/plugins/` (2.x) or
`.opencode/plugin/` (1.x), or link the package through an npm workspace. OpenCode also loads
TypeScript files placed directly in those directories.

## Configuration

The defaults are `mode: "on-ask"`, a 30-second review timeout, and the provider/model of the main
session.

OpenCode 2.x passes options through a `{ "package", "options" }` entry:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "opencode-auto-approval-plugin",
      "options": {
        "mode": "on-ask",
        "reviewer": {
          "timeoutMs": 30000,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

OpenCode 1.x uses a plugin tuple instead:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    [
      "opencode-auto-approval-plugin",
      {
        "mode": "on-ask",
        "reviewer": {
          "timeoutMs": 30000,
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

Set `reviewer.model` to run reviews through a separately configured OpenCode provider and model.
With the default `opencode` backend the plugin never reads or manages API keys; authentication
remains entirely in OpenCode.

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "opencode-auto-approval-plugin",
      "options": {
        "mode": "all-tools",
        "reviewer": {
          "model": {
            "providerID": "openrouter",
            "modelID": "openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
          },
          "timeoutMs": 15000,
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

### Jev reviewer backend

Set `reviewer.backend` to `"jev"` to have [TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai/)'s Jev decision model
judge each operation instead of an OpenCode session. The plugin sends one request to the System One
API with the operation (`source`, `action`, `resource`, and the user's latest prompt) and a single
`allow` / `deny` / `escalate` choice. No reviewer agent or session is created, the workspace is not
inspected, and a review typically answers in well under a second.

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "opencode-auto-approval-plugin",
      "options": {
        "mode": "on-ask",
        "reviewer": {
          "backend": "jev",
          "timeoutMs": 10000,
          "jev": {
            "model": "jev-latest",
            "minAllowProbability": 0.6,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

| Option                             | Environment variable | Default                   | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reviewer.backend`                 | —                    | `"opencode"`              | `"opencode"` (reviewer session) or `"jev"`                      |
| `reviewer.jev.apiKey`              | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`   | — (required for `jev`)    | TypeSafe AI API key                                             |
| `reviewer.jev.baseURL`             | `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL`  | `https://api.typesafe.ai` | API origin; a bare HTTPS origin (HTTP only for loopback)        |
| `reviewer.jev.model`               | —                    | `"jev-latest"`            | Jev model or alias; pin a version such as `jev-1.13.0`          |
| `reviewer.jev.minAllowProbability` | —                    | `0.6`                     | An `allow` answered with a lower probability becomes `escalate` |

- The key and the base URL come from the same place. With `reviewer.jev.apiKey`, only
  `reviewer.jev.baseURL` applies (`TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` is ignored); with `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, only
  `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL` applies, and setting `reviewer.jev.baseURL` without a key next to it fails at
  startup. This keeps one source from redirecting a key supplied by another.
- Prefer the `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` environment variable: `opencode.json` is often committed, and a key
  written there is shared with it. Surrounding whitespace in the key is trimmed.
- The plugin fails at startup when the `jev` backend has no API key or an invalid base URL. The
  variable is read by the process that loads the plugin: if OpenCode 2.x's background service was
  already running, run `opencode service restart` after exporting it.
- Jev returns a choice with calibrated probabilities rather than an explanation, so the verdict
  reason reads like `Jev chose deny (allow 0.00, deny 0.99, escalate 0.01).` A hesitant `allow`
  below `minAllowProbability` is escalated to a human; `deny` and `escalate` are taken as answered.
- The operation leaves your machine: the resource holds the full command, file content of a
  write or edit, and permission metadata such as diffs, and the user intent is your latest prompt.
  All of it is sent to TypeSafe AI (or `baseURL`), so an edit of a secrets file sends those secrets.
- A resource larger than 64,000 characters once encoded as JSON (for example a large file write) is sent as a
  truncated preview, and a prompt longer than 16,000 characters is cut; an `allow` for either is
  escalated, because Jev saw only part of it. With `on-ask` that leaves OpenCode's permission prompt;
  with `all-tools` such a tool call is always blocked, and retrying the same call does not help —
  split the write or switch to `on-ask`.
- `baseURL` must use HTTPS unless it points at a loopback host (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`). Whoever serves it receives the API key
  and decides every verdict, so set it only in configuration you trust (not a repository's
  `opencode.json` you have not reviewed) — the same holds for `minAllowProbability`, which lowers
  the bar for an automatic approval.
- Redirects are refused so the API key is never forwarded to another host, and the timeout covers
  the whole request including the response body. HTTP errors (`402` out of credit, `429` rate
  limited, `5xx` outage) are reported by status only and handled like any other reviewer failure.
- `reviewer.model` has no effect with the `jev` backend, and `reviewer.jev` none with `opencode`. `jev-latest` follows new model releases,
  which may shift verdicts; pin a version for stable behavior.

### Review modes

| Mode               | Reviewed operations                                           | `allow`                   | `deny`                               | `escalate` / reviewer failure                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `on-ask` (default) | Only operations that OpenCode already decided should ask      | Approves the request once | Leaves the OpenCode approval pending | Leaves the OpenCode approval pending                      |
| `all-tools`        | Every intercepted tool call, including OpenCode-allowed calls | Runs the tool             | Blocks the tool                      | Blocks the tool and reports that human review is required |

On OpenCode 2.x, `on-ask` runs inside the `permission.evaluate` hook: an `allow` verdict turns the
pending `ask` into `allow` before the permission prompt is shown, and the reviewer's reason is
attached as the permission message. On OpenCode 1.x the plugin listens for the permission bus
event and replies `once` through the SDK. In both cases anything other than `allow` leaves
OpenCode's native human permission UI untouched.

OpenCode's plugin API does not provide a way to create and await a new permission dialogue from
`tool.execute.before`. Therefore, `all-tools` fails closed for an `escalate` verdict: the tool does
not run and the user must explicitly retry after reviewing the reported reason.

Both modes work the same way with either reviewer backend, except that the Jev backend always
escalates an operation too large to send in full (see above).

Explicit OpenCode `deny` rules always remain in effect. The plugin is an additional review layer;
it never turns a built-in deny into an allow.

## mise tasks

| Task                    | Description                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `mise run actionlint`   | Lint GitHub Actions workflows                             |
| `mise run pinact`       | Pin actions in workflows to full commit SHAs              |
| `mise run pinact:check` | Fail if any action is not pinned to a commit SHA          |
| `mise run trivy`        | Scan `.devcontainer/` and workflows for misconfigurations |

## Supply chain hardening

- `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true`, so every dependency is pinned to an exact version.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `minimumReleaseAge: 1440`, so a version published less than a day ago is
  refused — a compromised release has time to be pulled before it reaches a lockfile.
- Postinstall scripts are blocked by default via `allowBuilds`; add a package there only when a build
  step is genuinely required. CI installs with `--ignore-scripts`.
- Every third-party GitHub Action is pinned to a full-length commit SHA, enforced by `pinact` in CI.
- Workflows declare the narrowest `permissions:` block they need.
- `secretlint` runs over every staged file through lint-staged, and over the whole tree in CI.
- `trivy config` scans `.devcontainer/` and `.github/workflows/` for misconfigurations on every push
  and pull request that touches them; `CRITICAL` and `HIGH` findings fail the build. Suppressions
  live in `.trivyignore`, each with the reason it is safe.
- The dev container pins the Codex CLI installer to a version and verifies its SHA-256 checksum
  before running it.

## Dev container

`.devcontainer/` provides a sandboxed environment for running AI coding agents with relaxed
permissions. It is adapted from [dyoshikawa/rulesync](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync) and
ships Node, mise-managed tooling (including `actionlint` and `pinact`), `gh`, Claude Code, Codex
CLI, opencode, Gemini CLI, git-gtr, and zsh/bash with completions.

Open the repository in a Dev Container-aware editor and it builds from `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`,
then runs `.devcontainer/init.sh` to configure git credentials, the pnpm store, and `pnpm install`.

Secrets are read from the host environment, so export the ones you need before opening the
container — all of them are optional:

| Host variable                                                   | Forwarded as         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_GITHUB_TOKEN`       | `GITHUB_TOKEN`       |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_OPENAI_API_KEY`     | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_GEMINI_API_KEY`     | `GEMINI_API_KEY`     |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_ZAI_API_KEY`        | `ZHIPU_API_KEY`      |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_OPENCODE_API_KEY`   | `OPENCODE_API_KEY`   |

`mise.toml` is copied into the image at build time, so changing it requires rebuilding the
container.

## AI coding agent rules

Rules live in `.rulesync/` and are compiled into each tool's native format by `pnpm generate`:

- `.rulesync/rules/*.md` — instructions (overview, coding, testing, GitHub Actions security)
- `.rulesync/mcp.json` — MCP servers
- `.rulesync/hooks.json` — session hooks
- `.rulesync/permissions.jsonc` — per-tool permission settings
- `rulesync.jsonc` — which tools to generate for (Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, opencode)

Generated files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.github/instructions/`, …) are gitignored —
edit `.rulesync/**` instead, never the generated output.

## Publishing

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes to npm when a GitHub Release is published, or when run
manually for a release tag. It checks that the tag is a semantic `v*.*.*` version, matches
`package.json`, and points to a commit in `main`; it then runs `pnpm cicheck`, builds, and publishes
through [npm Trusted Publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) (OIDC — no npm token in
secrets).

Configure npm's trusted publisher for `dyoshikawa/opencode-auto-approval-plugin` to use GitHub
Actions and the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` workflow. For each later release, bump the package
version on `main`, create its matching `v<version>` tag, and publish the GitHub Release.

OpenCode publishes and distributes plugins as ordinary npm packages: users add the package name to
the `plugins` (2.x) or `plugin` (1.x) array in `opencode.json`, and OpenCode installs it at startup.
See the [OpenCode plugin documentation](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/build/plugins/) and the
[V1 migration guide](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs/build/plugins/migrate-v1/) for the loader and
cache behavior.
