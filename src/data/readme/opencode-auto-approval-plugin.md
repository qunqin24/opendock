# opencode-auto-approval-plugin

An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) plugin that sends tool operations to a read-only AI reviewer
before automatically approving them.

The reviewer runs in its own OpenCode session. It may inspect the workspace with `read`, `glob`,
`grep`, and `lsp`, but cannot edit files, run shell commands, access the network, use MCP tools, or
start subagents.

## Install

OpenCode installs npm plugins listed in `opencode.json` automatically. Add the package to the
project or global OpenCode configuration:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-auto-approval-plugin"],
}
```

For local development, build the package and add the generated `dist/index.js` to
`.opencode/plugins/`, or link the package through an npm workspace. OpenCode also loads TypeScript
files placed directly in `.opencode/plugins/`.

## Configuration

Use a plugin tuple to pass options. The defaults are `mode: "on-ask"`, a 30-second review timeout,
and the provider/model of the main session.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    [
      "opencode-auto-approval-plugin",
      {
        "mode": "on-ask",
        "reviewer": {
          "timeoutMs": 30000,
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

Set `reviewer.model` to run reviews through a separately configured OpenCode provider and model.
The plugin never reads or manages API keys; authentication remains entirely in OpenCode.

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": [
    [
      "opencode-auto-approval-plugin",
      {
        "mode": "all-tools",
        "reviewer": {
          "model": {
            "providerID": "openrouter",
            "modelID": "openai/gpt-5.6-luna",
          },
          "timeoutMs": 15000,
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

### Review modes

| Mode               | Reviewed operations                                           | `allow`                      | `deny`                               | `escalate` / reviewer failure                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `on-ask` (default) | Only operations that OpenCode already decided should ask      | Sends an SDK `once` approval | Leaves the OpenCode approval pending | Leaves the OpenCode approval pending                      |
| `all-tools`        | Every intercepted tool call, including OpenCode-allowed calls | Runs the tool                | Blocks the tool                      | Blocks the tool and reports that human review is required |

OpenCode's public plugin API does not currently provide a way to create and await a new permission
dialogue from `tool.execute.before`. Therefore, `all-tools` fails closed for an `escalate` verdict:
the tool does not run and the user must explicitly retry after reviewing the reported reason. In
contrast, `on-ask` preserves OpenCode's native human permission UI.

Explicit OpenCode `deny` rules always remain in effect. The plugin is an additional review layer;
it never turns a built-in deny into an allow.

| Task                    | Description                                               |

| `mise run trivy`        | Scan `.devcontainer/` and workflows for misconfigurations |

## Supply chain hardening

- `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true`, so every dependency is pinned to an exact version.
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `minimumReleaseAge: 1440`, so a version published less than a day ago is
  refused — a compromised release has time to be pulled before it reaches a lockfile.
- Postinstall scripts are blocked by default via `allowBuilds`; add a package there only when a build
  step is genuinely required. CI installs with `--ignore-scripts`.
- Every third-party GitHub Action is pinned to a full-length commit SHA, enforced by `pinact` in CI.
- Workflows declare the narrowest `permissions:` block they need.
- `secretlint` runs over every staged file through lint-staged, and over the whole tree in CI.
- `trivy config` scans `.devcontainer/` and `.github/workflows/` for misconfigurations on every push
  and pull request that touches them; `CRITICAL` and `HIGH` findings fail the build. Suppressions
  live in `.trivyignore`, each with the reason it is safe.
- The dev container pins the Codex CLI installer to a version and verifies its SHA-256 checksum
  before running it.

## Dev container

`.devcontainer/` provides a sandboxed environment for running AI coding agents with relaxed
permissions. It is adapted from [dyoshikawa/rulesync](https://github.com/dyoshikawa/rulesync) and
ships Node, mise-managed tooling (including `actionlint` and `pinact`), `gh`, Claude Code, Codex
CLI, opencode, Gemini CLI, git-gtr, and zsh/bash with completions.

Open the repository in a Dev Container-aware editor and it builds from `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`,
then runs `.devcontainer/init.sh` to configure git credentials, the pnpm store, and `pnpm install`.

Secrets are read from the host environment, so export the ones you need before opening the
container — all of them are optional:

| Host variable                                                   | Forwarded as         |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_GITHUB_TOKEN`       | `GITHUB_TOKEN`       |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_OPENAI_API_KEY`     | `OPENAI_API_KEY`     |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_GEMINI_API_KEY`     | `GEMINI_API_KEY`     |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_ZAI_API_KEY`        | `ZHIPU_API_KEY`      |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN_DEVCONTAINER_OPENCODE_API_KEY`   | `OPENCODE_API_KEY`   |

`mise.toml` is copied into the image at build time, so changing it requires rebuilding the
container.

## AI coding agent rules

Rules live in `.rulesync/` and are compiled into each tool's native format by `pnpm generate`:

- `.rulesync/rules/*.md` — instructions (overview, coding, testing, GitHub Actions security)
- `.rulesync/mcp.json` — MCP servers
- `.rulesync/hooks.json` — session hooks
- `.rulesync/permissions.jsonc` — per-tool permission settings
- `rulesync.jsonc` — which tools to generate for (Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot, opencode)

Generated files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.github/instructions/`, …) are gitignored —
edit `.rulesync/**` instead, never the generated output.

## Publishing

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes to npm when a GitHub Release is published, or when run
manually for a release tag. It checks that the tag is a semantic `v*.*.*` version, matches
`package.json`, and points to a commit in `main`; it then runs `pnpm cicheck`, builds, and publishes
through [npm Trusted Publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) (OIDC — no npm token in
secrets).

Configure npm's trusted publisher for `dyoshikawa/opencode-auto-approval-plugin` to use GitHub
Actions and the `.github/workflows/publish.yml` workflow. For each later release, bump the package
version on `main`, create its matching `v<version>` tag, and publish the GitHub Release.

OpenCode publishes and distributes plugins as ordinary npm packages: users add the package name to
the `plugin` array in `opencode.json`, and OpenCode installs it with Bun at startup. See the
[OpenCode plugin documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/plugins/) for the loader and cache behavior.
