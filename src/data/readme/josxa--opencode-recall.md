> 🧠 **Searchable memory for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai).** Ask *"what did we figure out about X last month?"* and the agent actually finds it.

Every OpenCode session is already saved locally. Recall makes them searchable, so the agent can pull the right slice of a past conversation back into context on demand, instead of you re-explaining yourself or dumping whole sessions into the prompt.

## Why Recall?

You've already solved this problem. You debugged this exact error six weeks ago in another project. You worked out the deploy steps in a session you can't find anymore. The knowledge is *there*, sitting in `opencode.db`, but the agent can't see it.

Recall fixes that:

🔎 **Find the right session in seconds.** Hybrid lexical + semantic search across every project you've used OpenCode in.

📜 **Read the actual conversation, not a summary.** The agent pages a bounded window of messages around the match. Tool calls, patches, and file attachments render as structured ChatML, not a wall of JSON.

🎯 **Explicit by design.** Recall doesn't auto-inject memories. You (or the agent, when you ask) decide when to search. Your context window stays lean and you always know why something showed up in the prompt.

🔒 **Local and read-only.** Your `opencode.db` is never written to. The embedding index lives in a sidecar SQLite file you can delete any time.

## What it looks like

**Simple recall: "remind me how we did this."**

![Recall asking how trusted publishing was set up, agent runs history_search then history_read and returns the workflow config, publish command, and release flow](./assets/screenshot-01.png)

**Iterative recall: agent reformulates the search when the first pass is thin.**

![Recall asking about match marker file names, agent runs an initial broad search, then a narrower one with stronger terms and a directory filter, then returns a precise file list](./assets/screenshot-02.png)

## Install

```sh
opencode plugin @josxa/opencode-recall -gf
```

This installs the package and wires it into your global OpenCode config.

<details>
<summary>Manual installation</summary>

```sh
pnpm add -D @josxa/opencode-recall
```

Then register the plugin in `opencode.json` or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["@josxa/opencode-recall"]
}
```

</details>

## Set up embeddings (Ollama)

Semantic search uses [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running locally. Install it, that's it:

```sh
ollama --version  # should print a version. install from https://ollama.com/download if not.
```

Everything else is handled for you. The first `history_search` call will start `ollama serve` if it isn't running, pull the default embedding model (`all-minilm`, small and fast) if it isn't installed, and build the sidecar index. Subsequent calls reuse it and synchronize only sessions changed since the previous search.

Lexical search still works without Ollama, but you lose paraphrase recall, which is half the value.

## How to actually use it

Recall is explicit. Ask the dedicated subagent when you want old session context:

```text
@recall how did we set up trusted publishing last time?
@recall find the session where we debugged recall lookup accuracy
@recall what did we decide about the rate limiter design?
```

The `recall` subagent starts with fresh context, searches and reads past sessions, then returns only a concise answer to the parent agent. It reports useful source session ids, titles, and directories, but not internal `msg_...` cursors unless you explicitly ask for raw read anchors. That gives you the useful part of session-level querying without dumping raw transcript pages into the main conversation. If you ask a follow-up about the same recalled session, the parent should invoke `@recall` again instead of answering from memory.

The subagent only checks OpenCode history. It does not read current files, run commands, or verify whether old session facts are still true.

Some natural-language prompts that should trigger recall:

- *"Recall how we set up the GitHub Actions release workflow."*
- *"Did we ever debug the Postgres connection pool exhaustion? Find that conversation."*
- *"Pull up the session where we discussed the rate limiter design."*
- *"Search my history for anything about Figma MCP and Azure."*
- *"What were the file names involved when we worked on the timeline component?"*

The recall subagent runs `history_search`, picks a promising hit, calls `history_read` to load the surrounding messages, and can page forward or back if more context is needed.

## Configuration

Recall creates a config file automatically on first use:

```text
<opencode-config-base-path>/recall.jsonc
```

On a normal Linux/macOS setup that is `~/.config/opencode/recall.jsonc`.

Most users never need to edit it. Open it when your OpenCode database lives somewhere unusual, you want the sidecar index somewhere else, or you want to try a different embedding model.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosXa/opencode-recall/main/schema/config.schema.json",

  "database": {
    // OpenCode session database. Opened read-only; recall never writes here.
    // Default: ~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db
    "path": "~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db",

    // Sidecar embedding index. Safe to delete; rebuilt on next search.
    // Default: a filename derived from the canonical source path.
    "indexPath": "~/.local/share/opencode/opencode-recall-index.db"
  },

  "embeddings": {
    // Ollama base URL.
    // Default: http://127.0.0.1:11434
    "ollamaUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",

    // Try "mxbai-embed-large" for higher quality at the cost of speed and memory.
    // Default: all-minilm
    "model": "all-minilm"
  }
}
```

Environment variables still work as overrides for CI, MCP, and temporary experiments: `OPENCODE_DB_PATH`, `OPENCODE_RECALL_DB_PATH`, `OPENCODE_RECALL_OLLAMA_URL`, and `OPENCODE_RECALL_EMBED_MODEL`.

### Read V1 and V2 history from either runtime

Set the same named sources in both runtimes' `recall.jsonc` files:

```jsonc
{
  "database": {
    "sources": [
      { "id": "v1", "path": "~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db", "indexPath": "~/.local/share/opencode/recall-v1.db" },
      { "id": "v2", "path": "~/.local/share/opencode/opencode-v2.db", "indexPath": "~/.local/share/opencode/recall-v2.db" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each source has one sidecar shared by all Recall hosts. Event cursors, embeddings, sync locks and stale-row cleanup remain local to that source. Source databases remain read-only, and the hosts keep their own session databases. Missing sources are skipped without opening or pruning their sidecars. A cursor naming an unavailable source reports an error.

Source IDs must be unique and contain only letters, digits, `_` or `-`. Keep them stable across configs so saved cursors remain usable. Each canonical source path must be unique, each sidecar must be unique, and a sidecar cannot alias any source. Existing symlinks are resolved. A sidecar records its source identity atomically; conflicting configurations fail instead of reconciling the wrong database. Existing unbound indexes are rebuilt when first bound because their source cannot be established reliably. Use fresh per-source sidecars when migrating a previously shared index.

With multiple sources, results include `sourceId`, and cursors are qualified, for example `v1::msg_example` or `v2::ses_example`. Copy these exact values into read and save calls, including navigation cursors. Do not append offsets. Raw `msg_...` and `ses_...` inputs still work when only one available source contains the ID; ambiguous IDs produce an error listing qualified choices. Copies in different sources remain distinct results, and ranking, result limits, recent entries and session lists merge globally. A qualified `excludeSessionId` filters only that source; a raw exclusion applies to every source. Current-session exclusion is scoped to the host database when it matches a configured source.

The SDK accepts the same list as `new OpenCodeRecall({ sources: [...] })` or `searchHistory(query, { sources: [...] })`. Hits and transcript windows retain raw IDs plus `sourceId`; use the `cursor` and navigation fields to read. The worker SDK and direct SDK with a custom embedding provider share the same federation coordinator.

`database.path` / `database.indexPath` and SDK `historyDbPath` / `sidecarDbPath` remain supported for one source, with unchanged cursor output. The default source follows `OPENCODE_DB`, or `opencode.db` in the OpenCode data directory. Default sidecars use `opencode-recall-<source-path-hash>.db` so V1 and V2 cannot accidentally share an index. `OPENCODE_DB_PATH` or `OPENCODE_RECALL_DB_PATH` suppresses the configured source list for isolated runs; explicit SDK source lists take precedence. The former `legacyPath` option resolves to a separate `legacy` source; new configurations should use `sources`.

Run `pnpm run eval:embeddings` to compare installed embedding models against the local regression cases in [`docs/real-history-regressions.md`](./docs/real-history-regressions.md).

### Choosing the `recall` subagent model

Recall integrates with the native OpenCode `agent.recall` configuration instead of replacing it. The plugin always supplies Recall's description, subagent mode, prompt, and history-only tool permissions. Other agent settings, including `model`, `variant`, and `temperature`, stay under your control.

For example, configure a small model for Recall independently of the parent agent:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "agent": {
    "recall": {
      "model": "example-provider/recall-mini",
      "variant": "low"
    }
  }
}
```

Recall keeps this model when a parent agent uses a different one, matching native OpenCode subagent behavior. Each machine can select a provider and model available in its own OpenCode configuration. When `agent.recall` is unset, Recall uses OpenCode's normal default model resolution.

## Tool reference

Recall exposes four history tools. They are intended to be called by the `recall` subagent, not by the main agent directly.

…text and tool_call blocks…

</hist>
```

Tool calls, patches, and file attachments render as structured tags with explicit `truncated` / `original_chars` markers when content is capped. The `<nav/>` element gives the agent cursors to keep paging without re-searching. To read from the end upward, start with `mode="tail"`, then pass the returned `prev` cursor back with `mode="prev"` until enough context is loaded. `mode="full"` is intentionally rejected because large transcript responses can still be truncated by the outer tool transport.

```

- **Source of truth.** `opencode.db` is opened read-only. The plugin never writes to it.
- **Sidecar index.** A separate SQLite database (`opencode-recall-index.db`) stores text chunks, content hashes, and `Float32` embedding blobs. Synthetic `session-title:<id>` rows are indexed so proper-noun title queries beat noisy snippet matches.
- **Sync.** Searches use OpenCode's persisted event log to reconcile only changed sessions, including deletions. There is no watcher or background process. Existing sidecars upgrade automatically; custom eventless databases retain the timestamp fallback.
- **Ranking.** Lexical and semantic candidates are merged, scored with title/text/directory term ratios plus phrase boosts, filtered to require enough query-term overlap, and diversified to at most two hits per session. A small semantic-rescue lane admits paraphrase matches that miss lexical filters but have high embedding similarity.
- **Reads.** Windows are computed by `row_number()` over `(session_id, time_created, id)`, then parts are normalized into `text | tool | patch | file` and capped (tool input 2 000 chars, output 6 000 chars).

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run ai:check           # biome + tsc type-check
pnpm test                   # deterministic ranking + cursor tests
pnpm run eval:real-history  # regression suite against your local opencode.db
pnpm run build              # emits dist/
```

Code quality is enforced by `biome` and `tsc --noEmit`. See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the style guide.
