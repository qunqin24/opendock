# Context Task Planning

**Persistent, structured context for long-running AI coding tasks — auto-planned, auto-synced, auto-injected.**

Your agent plans the task, syncs the plan to disk as it works, and re-injects the right context at recovery points and when the task needs it — even after dozens of conversation rounds and multiple auto-compactions.

Works across Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and TraeCLI/Coco.

## The Problem

Long AI coding tasks fail in predictable ways:

- **Context windows fill up.** After many turns the model auto-compacts and loses the precise plan, the failed attempts, and the verification state.
- **The plan lives only in chat.** Switch session, machine, or model — and you re-explain everything from scratch.
- **Parallel work mixes up.** A second task quietly mutates the first one's state because there is no boundary.
- **"Done" is unverifiable.** Nobody can tell whether the task was implemented, verified, or silently abandoned.

This skill turns those failure modes into a file-backed, agent-managed contract.

## How It Works

A simple loop, repeated for as long as the task is alive.

### ① Plan — once, at the start
The agent first assesses whether durable tracking would help. Simple, one-shot work continues without a task question. For broad, multi-step, verification-heavy, or interruption-prone work, it offers durable tracking; if you accept—or explicitly asked to create a task—it confirms a task title/slug and captures goal, non-goals, acceptance criteria, constraints, and verification target into `.planning/<slug>/task_plan.md`.

If the brief is fuzzy, the agent should ask one focused question at a time, include a recommended answer, and inspect local code/docs first when they can answer it.

### ② Persist — continuously, as work happens
On every meaningful step the agent writes back to local files:
- `state.json` — machine-readable status, phase, next action, blockers
- `task_plan.md` — human-readable plan with a small **Hot Context** section on top
- `progress.md` — chronological execution log
- `findings.md` — distilled, durable conclusions worth re-reading

### ③ Inject — automatically when needed
Host plugins/hooks read the latest state and feed only the **smallest useful snapshot** back into the model:
- on session start
- before new turns when needed
- before launching sub-agents
- after the conversation gets compacted

The model never has to re-derive what it already figured out — the runtime hands it back.

## What You Actually Get

- **🧠 Compaction-proof context** — Hot Context stays small but always authoritative. After auto-compaction, the next turn still knows the goal, current phase, and next action.
- **📋 Structured plan-as-you-go** — A single conversation produces a real plan, a real progress log, and a real findings file — without you asking.
- **🔄 Cross-session / cross-host recovery** — Switch from Claude Code to Codex, close the laptop, come back tomorrow — pick up exactly where you stopped on any supported host.
- **🪟 Always-visible state** — Status-line cues, session titles, and injected reminders show which task is active, who owns it (writer vs. observer), and what repo/worktree it touches.
- **🚧 Safe parallelism** — Session bindings + writer/observer roles + per-task git worktrees keep two parallel tasks from trampling each other's files or branches.
- **✅ Real verification gate** — A task isn't "done" until verification is recorded in `progress.md`. No silent declarations of victory.
- **🧹 Prunable history** — If `progress.md` grows into thousands of lines, `context-prune.sh` prepares a model-reviewed summary, archives the full original, and keeps recovery reads small.

## When to Use

**Use it for:** multi-step tasks, long-running tasks, tasks likely to be interrupted, tasks requiring verification, work that crosses files or repos.

**Skip it for:** one-shot edits, simple changes completable in a short session.

Automatic skill selection does not create a task by itself and should stay quiet about tasks for simple work. When complex work may benefit from tracking and tracking was not explicitly requested, the agent should let you choose first.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install for your host

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add excitedhaha/context-task-planning
claude plugin install context-task-planning@context-task-planning
```

**OpenCode:**
```bash
npx skills add excitedhaha/context-task-planning -g
opencode plugin context-task-planning-opencode --global
```

**TraeCLI/Coco:**
```bash
coco plugin install --type=github excitedhaha/context-task-planning --name context-task-planning
```

**Codex:**
```bash
codex plugin marketplace add excitedhaha/context-task-planning
```

Then open the Codex app plugin browser, or run `codex` and open `/plugins`, and install or enable `context-task-planning`.

For local checkout development, use `sh skill/scripts/install-codex-plugin.sh` as a fallback wrapper.

### 2. Start one real task

Just talk normally. For work that appears to need durable tracking, the agent will ask whether you want a task; only after you accept will it propose a title/slug and start tracking under `.planning/<slug>/`.

```
Refactor the auth flow across backend and frontend. This will take multiple
steps and should be verified before wrap-up.
```

### 3. Watch the runtime work

As you keep talking, you should see:
- a `task:<slug>` cue in your host (status line / session title / injected reminder)
- `.planning/<slug>/task_plan.md` and `progress.md` updated as the agent works
- the agent stays on goal across many turns without needing to be re-briefed

Host-specific cues:
- **Claude Code**: Task context auto-injected; optional status-line shows `task!:<slug>` / `obs:<slug>` / `wksp:<slug>`
- **OpenCode**: Session title shows `task:<slug> | ...`
- **TraeCLI/Coco**: Task context auto-injected
- **Codex**: Optional hooks inject task reminders on new turns

### 4. (Bonus) Try a recovery

Close the session, open a new one in the same repo, and say:

```
Resume the active task from local planning files.
```

The agent reads `.planning/<slug>/`, rebuilds context from `state.json` plus Hot Context, and continues from the recorded next action.

**🎉 Once the loop works, read [docs/onboarding.md](docs/onboarding.md) for the full journey.**

## Daily Scenarios

### A. Long refactor over many turns
The plan keeps the goal/non-goals stable. The agent writes progress as it goes. After 30+ turns and one auto-compaction, the next turn still knows exactly which file it was about to touch.

### B. Switching hosts mid-task
You started in Claude Code, ran out of quota, opened OpenCode in the same repo. The new session reads `.planning/<slug>/` and resumes — no re-briefing.

### C. Parallel tasks in the same repo
Main session keeps refactoring auth. A second session is bound as an **observer** to help review without touching the main planning files — or as a **writer** in a separate `.worktrees/<slug>/` checkout when it also needs to write code.

### D. Cross-repo task from a parent workspace
One task spans `frontend/` and `backend/`. Register both repos once, scope the task to them, and the agent treats them as one task instead of two disconnected pieces.

## Core Concepts

### Task file structure

```
.planning/<slug>/
  task_plan.md    # task framework and hot context
  findings.md     # refined conclusions
  progress.md     # execution history
  state.json      # operational snapshot
```

*You don't need to read these files. They exist so the agent can be reset at any time and still know what to do.*

## Limitations

- This is a **context layer**, not a team task-management tool — optimized for one developer plus AI agents on a workstation.
- File-based portable contract; host-specific UI differs.
- No built-in cross-machine coordination.
- No host-specific session-history catchup layer.
- Optional adapters are reminders and visibility aids, not a hard transaction system.
