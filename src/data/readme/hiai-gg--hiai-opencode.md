> A multi-agent engineering team that lives inside your editor. One plugin gives [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) an orchestrator, a planner, senior engineers, a critic, a designer, a researcher, and a browser operator — all coordinating autonomously, with enforced review gates and live diagnostics.

**hiai-opencode** is an OpenCode plugin that turns a single AI session into a self-directing team. Instead of one model doing everything, Bob (the orchestrator) writes a plan **once**, dispatches parallel waves, and runs a **single** Critic at delivery. Explore researches, Build implements, Vision verifies UIs. The plan-lifecycle gate and completion controller enforce that — not prompt theater.

---

## Why

Most AI coding tools drop you into one big context window and hope the model self-manages. The result is predictable: the model edits a file, declares victory, and moves on — no review, no diagnostics run, no verification that the tests pass. **hiai-opencode fixes the loop:**

- 🛡️ **Code never ships unreviewed.** After a frozen plan's waves finish, a dedicated Critic must return `APPROVED` once. The completion controller and plan-lifecycle gate enforce it — not per-todo prompt theater.
- 🔍 **Diagnostics are mandatory, not optional.** Edit a file and the completion gate blocks until `lsp_diagnostics` has run clean and any failing `test` / `lint` / `typecheck` passes.
- 🧠 **A real team, not a monologue.** Bob routes by category — quick work to a cheap executor, hard implementation to a Senior Engineer, architecture to a Principal Architect, UI to a Designer, docs to a Writer.
- 🗜️ **Context that survives compaction.** Long sessions compact gracefully — in-memory gate state (failed quality check, pending diagnostics, unreviewed changes) is re-injected into the compaction context so the post-compaction agent still knows what blocks completion.
- ⚡ **Local-first runtime.** Memory, LSP, and browser execution stay local. Model prompts are sent to the providers you connect, while optional `grep_app` and Firecrawl features call their documented remote services.
- 🪝 **One line to install.** No separate MCP server config, no manual wiring — `opencode plugin @hiai-gg/hiai-opencode@latest --global`.

---

## Install

### 1. Install the plugin

```bash
opencode plugin @hiai-gg/hiai-opencode@latest --global
```

That's the whole setup. The plugin self-registers its agents, hooks, tools, and MCP servers.

### 2. Connect your model providers

In OpenCode, connect your providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.) and run:

```bash
opencode models
```

Copy the exact `provider/model-id` strings into your `bob.json` override (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### 3. (Optional) Set API keys for CLI skills

```bash
cp bob.env.example bob.env
# Edit bob.env — add FIRECRAWL_API_KEY for web scraping (optional)
```

### 4. (Optional) Install browser automation

Vision's browser tools talk to a local engine over CDP. Engine selection is automatic: **Lightpanda** when its binary is on your PATH, **Chrome** otherwise.

Install the CLI and provision the Chrome fallback:

```bash
bun add -g agent-browser && agent-browser install
```

**Lightpanda** ([lightpanda.io](https://lightpanda.io)) — optional, preferred when installed, headless-only. Separate user-level install via the official installer, not `cargo`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.lightpanda.io/install.sh | bash
```

Force an engine per session with `AGENT_BROWSER_ENGINE=chrome|lightpanda`, or per run with `agent-browser --engine chrome|lightpanda open <url>`. Headed mode (`AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED=1`) works only with Chrome.

### 5. Verify

```bash
opencode debug config
hiai-opencode doctor      # now a real executable since v0.3.6
hiai-opencode mcp-status
```

`doctor` exits non-zero on hard failures, so you can use it as a CI gate.

### Want OpenCode to finish setup for you?

Paste this into a fresh session:

```text
Read AGENTS.md and finish hiai-opencode setup for this workspace.
Check that @hiai-gg/hiai-opencode is registered, enable MCP services that can run here
(sequential-thinking: node/npx; grep_app: no key), verify with opencode debug config
and hiai-opencode doctor.
Install and configure browser automation for Vision as documented in AGENTS.md:
bun add -g agent-browser && agent-browser install, plus Lightpanda via its official
installer when possible. Verify with agent-browser --version and lightpanda version
(if installed), then run hiai-opencode doctor again.
Report missing keys without printing secret values.
```

## How a task runs (v0.6.3+)

```
trivial (1–2 files)     → general                     → (Critic only if high-risk)
non-trivial             → Plan once → freeze
                        → parallel task() waves
                        → one Critic at delivery
                          (Vision if UI) → you
```

Plan is not rewritten until it is done or you change scope (`INVALIDATE_PLAN`). Critic is not called after each checkbox. Independent steps of a phase must be dispatched as **several `task()` calls in the same assistant turn**.

### Agents — a specialist team

Bob routes work; the rest execute. Three are visible in the picker (you can invoke them directly); the rest are invoked by Bob or auto-triggered.

| Agent | Role | When it kicks in |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Bob** (orchestrator) | Routes work, freezes the plan, dispatches waves. Never writes code. | Always — your entry point |
| **Plan** (Strategist) | Deep planning, architecture, read-only. Writes `.bob/plans/`. | Once, at the start of non-trivial work (or user-invoked) |
| **Build** (Senior Engineer) | Multi-file implementation of a frozen plan step | `deep` category — the workhorse |
| **General** | Fast bounded executor | `quick` category (1–2 files) |
| **Explore** (Researcher) | Codebase grep, web search (Firecrawl/grep_app), library docs | Discovery inside Plan, or a Bob research route |
| **Critic** | Binary delivery gate — `APPROVED` or `REJECTED` | Once, after all waves (not per step) |
| **Designer** | UI/visual direction, design systems, component specs | `visual-engineering` |
| **Writer** | Copy, positioning, SEO, docs | `writing` |
| **Vision** | Browser operator, multimodal analysis, screenshots | UI verification, usually via delivery Critic |
| **Manager** | Large-phase coordinator (many workers). One Critic at phase close. Not for 1–2 file work. | One large phase (≥5 worker steps) |

### Tools — 35 registered

- **LSP (6)** — `lsp_diagnostics`, `lsp_goto_definition`, `lsp_find_references`, `lsp_symbols`, `lsp_prepare_rename`, `lsp_rename`. TypeScript, Svelte, ESLint, Python, Bash.
- **Agent Browser (14)** — Navigate, snapshot, click, fill, screenshot, eval, console, and more. CDP via Lightpanda (preferred when installed) or Chrome (fallback) — no Playwright. Restricted to Vision/General agents.
- **Memory (1)** — `hiai_memory_search`: BM25-ranked SQLite FTS5 search over MEMORY.md, checkpoints, notes, and task progress.
- **Session Manager (4)** — List, read, search, and inspect sessions.
- **Worktree (4)** — `hiai_worktree_create`/`_list`/`_remove`/`_status` for isolated parallel work.
- **Skills (1)** — `skill("build/shadcn-ui")`, `skill("explore/context7")`, etc.
- **Firecrawl (3)** — Web scrape, search, sitemap (CLI skill, requires `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`).

**Browser engines (auto-selected):** the runtime prefers **Lightpanda** ([lightpanda.io](https://lightpanda.io); headless-only) when its binary is on your PATH and `AGENT_BROWSER_ENGINE` is unset; **Chrome** is the fallback. Override per session with `AGENT_BROWSER_ENGINE=chrome|lightpanda`, or per run with `agent-browser --engine chrome|lightpanda open <url>`. Headed mode (`AGENT_BROWSER_HEADED=1`) works only with Chrome. Lightpanda installs separately via its official installer (not `cargo`) — neither the npm plugin nor `agent-browser install` downloads it. See [Install](#install).

### MCP servers — 2, zero-config

| Server | Type | Use |
|--------|------|-----|
| `sequential-thinking` | local (npx) | Optional extra reasoning. Plan uses native model thinking by default. |
| `grep_app` | remote | GitHub OSS code search — no key required |

The plugin auto-exports `.opencode/.mcp.json` at startup so `opencode mcp list` sees these servers. Control it via `HIAI_OPENCODE_AUTO_EXPORT_MCP` (`if-missing` / `always` / `off`).

### Execution gates — enforced, not suggested

| Gate | What it enforces |
|------|-----------------|
| **Plan freeze** | After Plan returns `Status: done`, a second Plan spawn is denied until the plan is done or `INVALIDATE_PLAN` |
| **Delivery Critic** | Changed files on a finished plan need one `APPROVED` verdict — not a review after every specialist |
| **Quality gate** | Failed `test`/`lint`/`typecheck` blocks completion until it passes |
| **LSP gate** | Edits block completion until `lsp_diagnostics` runs clean |
| **Legal gate** | Hard-blocks browser-automation abuse, malicious tool use (throws) |
| **Circuit breaker** | Aborts sessions stuck in loops (20+ identical calls, or 4000+ total) |
| **Closure protocol** | Every agent response must carry a valid `<CLOSURE>` block |

### Hooks — 30, categorized (includes `plan-lifecycle-gate`)

Safety · Quality · Recovery · System · Lifecycle. All chainable, all disable-able via `hooks.disabled` in config. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full list.

### Memory systems — two complementary backends

- **Native `memory`** (OpenCode built-in) — full-text indexed curated MD files for durable knowledge.
- **`hiai_memory_search`** (plugin) — SQLite FTS5 BM25 over session transcripts and tool outputs for forensic cross-session recall.

Plus **Dream** (7-day) and **Distill** (30-day) auto-consolidation that promotes durable knowledge into MEMORY.md and packages repeated workflows into new skills.

## CLI — `hiai-opencode`

The package ships a `hiai-opencode` binary (also the OpenCode plugin name). It wraps diagnostics **and** stack management for the OpenCode server + web UI.

### Run the server + web UI

```bash
hiai-opencode              # same as `up` — launches the stack
hiai-opencode up            # opencode serve (headless) + opencode web (frontend)
hiai-opencode down          # stop the stack
hiai-opencode restart       # down, then up
hiai-opencode status        # show running serve/web PIDs + ports
```

- **Server** runs `opencode serve` (headless API) on port `4096` by default.
- **Frontend** runs `opencode web` (built-in web UI) on port `4097` by default.
- PIDs and ports are tracked in `~/.hiai-opencode/run/opencode-stack.json` so `down` / `status` can manage the spawned processes.

Override ports or host:

```bash
hiai-opencode up --serve-port 5000 --web-port 5001 --host 0.0.0.0
# or via env
HIAI_OPENCODE_SERVE_PORT=5000 HIAI_OPENCODE_WEB_PORT=5001 hiai-opencode
```

> **Cline bridge** is an OpenCode *provider* entry (configured in `opencode.jsonc` / `bob.json`), **not** a separate process. `up` does not start any bridge — it only ensures the plugin is registered and launches `serve` + `web`.

### Diagnostics

```bash
hiai-opencode doctor        # full install/runtime diagnostic (exits non-zero on hard failures)
hiai-opencode mcp-status    # MCP server config + tool probes
hiai-opencode export-mcp [path]   # write static .mcp.json for hosts that ignore plugin MCP
hiai-opencode diagnose [path]    # collect diagnostic bundle (local only)
```

`doctor` checks: plugin registration, MCP servers, LSP runtimes (TypeScript/Svelte/ESLint/Bash/Pyright), CLI skills (Firecrawl / Context7 / agent-browser), model-slot assignment from `bob.json`, and the static `.mcp.json` freshness. Use it as a CI gate.

---

## Configuration

The plugin ships sane defaults in [bob.json](bob.json). To customize, drop a `bob.json` in your project root (or `.opencode/`) — it merges over the bundled defaults.

### `bob.json` — models & behaviour

The 10 model slots: `bob`, `build`, `plan`, `manager`, `critic`, `designer`, `explore`, `writer`, `vision`, `general`. Defaults ship in the plugin; override only what you want to change:

```jsonc
{
  "models": {
    "bob": { "model": "openai/gpt-5.5" },
    "build": { "model": "opencode-go/deepseek-v4-pro" },
    "plan": { "model": "opencode-go/deepseek-v4-pro" },
    "manager": { "model": "opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash" },
    "critic": { "model": "opencode-go/mimo-v2.5-pro" },
    "designer": { "model": "opencode-go/kimi-k2.7-code" },
    "explore": { "model": "opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash" },
    "writer": { "model": "opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash" },
    "vision": { "model": "opencode-go/mimo-v2.5" },
    "general": { "model": "opencode-go/deepseek-v4-flash" }
  },
  "mcp": {
    "sequential-thinking": { "enabled": true },
    "grep_app": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

Connect providers in OpenCode, run `opencode models`, and copy exact `provider/model-id` strings — don't invent prefixes. Model provider credentials live in OpenCode Connect, not in `bob.json`.

**One file:** `bob.json` (or `bob.jsonc`). First found wins, walking **up** from the directory OpenCode was started in: `bob.json` → `.opencode/bob.json` → jsonc variants, each parent until the filesystem root, then `~/.config/hiai-opencode/bob.json`. Bundled defaults are the baseline, not a competing file. `loop.enabled` (default true) continues Bob on idle until the plan and todos are done.

### `bob.env` — service keys (git-ignored)

```bash
cp bob.env.example bob.env
# FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-...   (optional — web scraping skill)
# CONTEXT7_API_KEY=ctx7-...  (optional — on-demand library docs)
```

Never put raw keys in JSON — use `{env:VAR_NAME}` placeholders. Never commit `bob.env`.
