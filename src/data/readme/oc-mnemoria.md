## What it does

Every time you start a new OpenCode session, your AI assistant loses all
context from previous conversations. oc-mnemoria fixes this by giving all
agents a shared "hive mind" — a single persistent memory store where every
agent can read and write.

Each memory entry is tagged with the agent that created it (plan, build, ask,
review, ...) so any agent can tell who recorded what. The build agent can see
what the plan agent decided; the review agent can recall bugs the build agent
fixed. No context is lost between roles.

Memories are stored locally in an append-only binary file using
[mnemoria](https://github.com/one-bit/mnemoria) — a Rust engine with hybrid
BM25 + semantic search, CRC32 checksum chains, and corruption recovery.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) (to install the mnemoria CLI)
- [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) (v0.1+)
- Node.js >= 18

## Installation

Run the install script in your project directory:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/one-bit/oc-mnemoria/main/install.sh | sh
```

The script:

1. Installs the `mnemoria` CLI (via `cargo install` if needed)
2. Adds `"oc-mnemoria"` to the plugin array in `opencode.json`
3. Installs `/mn-*` slash commands to `.opencode/commands/`

After installation, restart OpenCode and run:

```sh
/mn-stats
```

You should see memory store statistics (entry count, file size, timestamps).

## How it works

### Storage layout

All agents share a single memory store:

```
.opencode/mnemoria/
  log.bin           # append-only binary log
  manifest.json     # metadata and checksums
  mnemoria.lock     # advisory file lock
```

You can interact with the store directly using the `mnemoria` CLI:

```sh
mnemoria --path .opencode stats
mnemoria --path .opencode search "authentication"
mnemoria --path .opencode export memories.json
```

### Agent tagging

Every memory entry is tagged with the agent that created it via mnemoria's
native `--agent` flag. The agent name is a first-class field on each entry,
visible in search results, timeline output, and JSON exports.

```sh
# Search only the build agent's memories
mnemoria --path .opencode search -a build "authentication"

# Show only the plan agent's timeline
mnemoria --path .opencode timeline -a plan
```

### Intent capture

The plugin automatically extracts user intents from chat messages via the
`chat.message` hook. When a user describes a goal or task, the plugin
categorizes it (e.g. fix, refactor, feature) and stores it in the shared
memory, tagged with the current agent. Duplicate intents within the same
session are deduplicated.

Agents can also store memories explicitly using the `remember` tool for
discoveries, decisions, solutions, and other observations worth preserving.

### System prompt injection

At the start of each session, the plugin injects cross-agent context into
the system prompt via the `experimental.chat.system.transform` hook:

- **Memory guidance** — instructions for when to use `search_memory`,
  `ask_memory`, and `remember`
- **Recent context** — the latest memories from the shared store, each
  showing which agent created it
- **Relevant memories** — search results matched against the current user
  intent (if one exists)
- **Past user goals** — intents from previous sessions so the agent
  understands prior work

## Tools

| Tool            | Description                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `remember`      | Store a categorized observation in shared memory     |
| `search_memory` | Search by keyword/semantic similarity               |
| `ask_memory`    | Ask a natural language question                     |
| `memory_stats`  | View statistics for the shared store                |
| `timeline`      | Browse memories chronologically (all agents)        |
| `forget`        | Mark a memory as obsolete (append-only tombstone)   |
| `compact`       | Remove forgotten entries/markers and optionally prune old data |

### Entry types

Observations are categorized when stored:

`intent` `discovery` `decision` `problem` `solution` `pattern` `warning`
`success` `refactor` `bugfix` `feature`

## Slash commands

| Command              | Description                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `/mn-ask <q>`        | Ask about past decisions             |
| `/mn-search <q>`     | Search memories                      |
| `/mn-stats`          | Show memory statistics               |
| `/mn-recent`         | Show recent memories                 |
| `/mn-timeline`       | Chronological view                   |
| `/mn-forget ...`     | Mark a memory as forgotten/obsolete  |
| `/mn-compact`        | Compact store by removing forgotten data |

## Inspecting memories from the command line

You can use the `mnemoria` CLI directly to browse, search, and manage the
memory store outside of OpenCode. All commands use `--path .opencode` to
point at your project's store (mnemoria auto-appends `mnemoria/` to resolve
the actual data directory).

### Browse the timeline

```sh
# Most recent 20 entries (newest first)
mnemoria --path .opencode timeline -r

# Last 5 entries
mnemoria --path .opencode timeline -r -l 5

# Only entries from the build agent
mnemoria --path .opencode timeline -a build

# Entries from a specific time range (Unix ms timestamps)
mnemoria --path .opencode timeline -s 1700000000000 -u 1700100000000
```

Output looks like:

```
Timeline (3 entries):
1. [discovery] (build) Found async pattern in auth module - 1700000100000
2. [decision] (plan) Use JWT for session tokens - 1700000050000
3. [intent] (plan) Fix authentication flow - 1700000000000
```

### Search memories

```sh
# Keyword + semantic hybrid search
mnemoria --path .opencode search "authentication"

# Limit results
mnemoria --path .opencode search "error handling" -l 5

# Search only one agent's memories
mnemoria --path .opencode search -a review "security"
```

### Ask a question

```sh
# Ask a natural language question against the memory store
mnemoria --path .opencode ask "What decisions were made about the database schema?"

# Scoped to a single agent
mnemoria --path .opencode ask -a plan "What was the original plan for auth?"
```

### View statistics

```sh
mnemoria --path .opencode stats
```

```
Memory Statistics:
  Total entries: 42
  File size: 4096 bytes
  Oldest entry: 1700000000000
  Newest entry: 1700001000000
```

### Export to JSON

```sh
mnemoria --path .opencode export memories.json
```

This produces a JSON array with full entry data including `agent_name`,
`entry_type`, `summary`, `content`, `timestamp`, and checksum fields.
Useful for scripting, analysis, or migrating data.

### Add a memory manually

```sh
mnemoria --path .opencode add \
  -a build \
  -t decision \
  -s "Switched from REST to GraphQL" \
  "After benchmarking, GraphQL reduced payload size by 60%"
```

The `-t` flag accepts any entry type: `intent`, `discovery`, `decision`,
`problem`, `solution`, `pattern`, `warning`, `success`, `refactor`,
`bugfix`, `feature`. Defaults to `discovery` if omitted.

### Verify store integrity

```sh
mnemoria --path .opencode verify
```

Checks the CRC32 checksum chain across all entries. Returns a non-zero exit
code on corruption, making it suitable for CI or pre-commit hooks.

## Memory maintenance workflows

Over time, some memories become outdated. oc-mnemoria supports a two-step
maintenance flow:

1. Mark obsolete entries with `forget` (append-only marker)
2. Run `compact` to physically rebuild the store without forgotten entries

### In OpenCode (recommended)

Use slash commands:

```sh
/mn-search flaky test timeout
/mn-forget id=8d9f... reason="Superseded by retry policy"
/mn-compact
```

Optionally prune old entries during compaction:

```sh
/mn-compact 90
```

(`90` means `maxAgeDays=90`)

### What each step does

- `forget` keeps history intact by writing a tombstone marker
- `compact` removes forgotten markers/entries and optionally old data
- This keeps the memory store accurate while preserving auditability between runs

## Git integration

Mnemoria's append-only binary format is designed for version control. You
can commit the memory store to track history alongside your code:

```sh
git add .opencode/
git commit -m "update agent memories"
```

Or ignore it:

```sh
echo ".opencode/mnemoria/" >> .gitignore  # ignore just the memory store
```

## FAQ

**How much disk space does this use?**
The store starts empty. A typical entry is ~100-500 bytes. Active daily use
produces roughly 2-10 MB per year.

**Is my data sent anywhere?**
No. Everything stays on your local filesystem. The mnemoria engine runs
entirely offline.

**How fast is it?**
The mnemoria Rust engine delivers sub-millisecond search latency for
typical store sizes (<10k entries). The plugin shells out to the CLI, so
there's ~50ms overhead per operation from process spawning.

**Can I reset the memory?**
Delete the store directory:
```sh
rm -rf .opencode/mnemoria/
```

**Can I search only one agent's memories?**
Yes. Pass the `agent` parameter to `search_memory`, `ask_memory`, or
`timeline`. From the CLI: `mnemoria --path .opencode search -a build "auth"`.
