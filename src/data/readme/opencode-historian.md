# OpenCode Historian

Persistent memory for OpenCode agents, powered by QMD.

Historian helps your agent remember decisions, preferences, learnings, and project context across sessions. It stores memories as markdown, indexes them with QMD, and exposes tools for remembering, recalling, forgetting, and syncing memory.

## What You Get

- Persistent memory across conversations
- Semantic search over saved memories
- Built-in memory types for decisions, issues, learnings, and preferences
- Markdown-based storage in your repo
- A bundled `historian` agent and memory tools
- Bundled `mnemonics` and `heuristics` skills for better agent memory workflows
- Optional Serena MCP support for code navigation

## Prerequisites

- **Bun** `1.3.9+`
- **QMD** installed globally
- **MarkItDown** optional, for better document extraction with the `heuristics` skill

Install QMD:

```bash
npm install -g qmd
# or
bun install -g qmd
```

Optional: install MarkItDown if you want `heuristics` to convert PDFs, Office documents, HTML, and other document formats before storing memories:

```bash
pip install markitdown
```

If MarkItDown is not installed, `heuristics` can still use LLM extraction or other available tools as a fallback.

## Install the Plugin

Add the plugin to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["opencode-historian"]
}
```

That is enough to register the plugin, the bundled `historian` agent, and the memory tools.

## Install the Skills

The plugin also includes skills that teach agents how to use Historian well:

- `mnemonics` - memory management guidance for `@historian`
- `heuristics` - source-to-memory ingestion for files and folders

Recommended install:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/5kahoisaac/opencode-historian/tree/main/src --skill mnemonics
npx skills add https://github.com/5kahoisaac/opencode-historian/tree/main/src --skill heuristics
```

After installing them:

- agents can load `mnemonics` for guidance on memory types, when to use `@historian`, and how to store or recall project knowledge correctly
- agents can load `heuristics` when you want to ingest documents, screenshots, notes, code, or mixed source folders into memories

## Quick Start

Once the plugin is enabled, talk to the historian agent in natural language.

### Save information

> "Remember that we're using PostgreSQL for the database"
>
> "Save this: we decided on JWT tokens with 24-hour expiry"
>
> "Note that the API rate limit is 100 requests per minute"

### Recall information

> "What did we decide about authentication?"
>
> "Do we have any known issues?"
>
> "What are my preferences for this project?"

### Ingest files or folders

Use the `heuristics` skill when you want the agent to turn existing source files into memories:

> "Use heuristics to ingest ./docs into historian memories"
>
> "Use heuristics on ./research and only save architectural decisions and issues"
>
> "Use heuristics to extract these screenshots into memory: ./notes/*.png"

The skill takes inspiration from the useful part of the "Karpathy LLM Wiki" idea: ingest source material into a durable knowledge base. Instead of adding a separate wiki system, it keeps Historian's existing qmd-backed memory model as the source of truth.

The skill checks available memory types first, extracts content from each file, classifies durable knowledge, and saves it through `@historian`. It can use `markitdown` for documents when available, vision MCPs for images, and LLM extraction as a fallback.

Historian will:

- classify memories by type
- tag them for retrieval
- index them for semantic search
- keep them in a git-friendly markdown format

## Memory Types

Historian ships with these built-in memory types:

| Type                     | Use For                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `architectural-decision` | System architecture choices |
| `design-decision`        | UI/UX decisions             |
| `learning`               | Lessons and discoveries     |
| `user-preference`        | User preferences            |
| `project-preference`     | Team conventions            |
| `issue`                  | Known problems              |
| `context`                | General context (default)   |
| `recurring-pattern`      | Reusable patterns           |
| `conventions-pattern`    | Coding standards            |

## Configuration

Optional config file:

```text
.opencode/opencode-historian.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "appendPrompt": "Focus on API design decisions.",
  "memoryTypes": [
    {
      "name": "api-endpoint",
      "description": "API endpoint decisions"
    }
  ],
  "disabledMcps": [
    "serena"
  ]
}
```

### Options

| Option         | Default | Description                                                               |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `model`        | -       | Model used by the historian agent                                         |
| `temperature`  | `0.3`   | Response creativity                                                       |
| `appendPrompt` | -       | Additional instructions appended to the historian prompt                  |
| `memoryTypes`  | -       | Custom memory types to add alongside the built-ins                        |
| `autoCompound` | `true`  | Automatically merge new learnings into existing memories when appropriate |
| `disabledMcps` | -       | Bundled MCPs to disable, for example `["serena"]`                         |

## Storage

Memories are stored as markdown files under `.mnemonics/` in your project root:

```text
.mnemonics/
├── architectural-decision/
├── design-decision/
├── learning/
└── ...
```

Benefits:

- human-readable
- easy to version with git
- easy to inspect or edit manually

## Included Tools

The plugin registers these memory tools:

- `memory_remember`
- `memory_recall`
- `memory_forget`
- `memory_list_types`
- `memory_sync`

## When to Use the Skill vs. the Tools

- Use the **plugin** to make memory available inside OpenCode
- Use the **`mnemonics` skill** to teach agents how to use `@historian` well
- Use the **`heuristics` skill** to convert existing files or folders into historian memories
- Use the **memory tools** when you want direct programmatic memory operations

In short: the plugin gives you capability, and the skills give agents better judgment about how to use it.
