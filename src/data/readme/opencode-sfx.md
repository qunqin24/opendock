# opencode-sfx

OpenCode plugin that plays your own sound effects for key agent moments.

## Installation

Add it to your OpenCode config, OpenCode will download/manage it for you:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["opencode-sfx"]
}
```

## Event Folders

Default sound root:

`~/.config/opencode/opencode-sfx/sounds`

On startup, the plugin checks whether this root and each event folder already exists before creating anything new. It never deletes existing files.

If `soundRoot` is missing on first bootstrap, the plugin copies the entire bundled `assets/` tree into `soundRoot` so event folders are prefilled out of the box. It also seeds bundled assets when all configured event folders are empty.

Put one or more clips directly in each event folder (non-recursive):

| OpenCode event | Folder name |
|---|---|
| plugin load | `sessionStart/` |
| `session.created` | `sessionCreated/` |
| `tui.command.execute` (`prompt.submit`) | `promptSubmit/` |
| `permission.updated` (and `permission.ask`) | `permission/` |
| `session.error` | `notification/` |
| `session.status` (`status.type === "idle"`) | `stop/` |

Supported file types:

- `.ogg`
- `.wav`
- `.mp3`

When an event fires, one clip is chosen at random from that folder.

## Configuration

Optional config file:

`~/.config/opencode/opencode-sfx.json`

Minimal example:

```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

Full example:

```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "soundRoot": "opencode-sfx/sounds",
  "playerCommand": "ffplay",
  "playerArgs": ["-loglevel", "quiet", "-nodisp", "-autoexit"],
  "events": {
    "sessionStart": true,
    "sessionCreated": true,
    "promptSubmit": true,
    "notification": true,
    "permission": true,
    "stop": true
  },
  "eventFolders": {
    "sessionStart": "sessionStart",
    "sessionCreated": "sessionCreated",
    "promptSubmit": "promptSubmit",
    "notification": "notification",
    "permission": "permission",
    "stop": "stop"
  }
}
```

Config notes:

- If `playerCommand` is omitted, the plugin auto-detects a player:
  - macOS: `afplay`, then `ffplay`
  - Linux: `paplay`, then `aplay`, then `ffplay`
  - Windows: `ffplay`
- `playerCommand` should be an executable name/path, and `playerArgs` should list each argument separately.
- Relative `soundRoot` paths are resolved from `~/.config/opencode/`.
- Relative `eventFolders` paths are resolved from `soundRoot`.
- Event folder scanning is non-recursive.
