# opencode-ember

[![CI](https://github.com/ozandogrultan/opencode-ember/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ozandogrultan/opencode-ember/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Keep an LLM prompt cache **warm across a break**, guard a **cold rewrite**
before you pay for it, and see exactly what the break cost.

A port of [`cache-tax`](https://github.com/karanb192/claude-code-mods/tree/main/plugins/cache-tax)
to [opencode](https://opencode.ai). One self-contained plugin file, no runtime
dependencies.

> Why "ember": a banked fire you keep smoldering while you are away.

## What it does

- **The cache stays warm by default.** Every session stays armed while opencode runs;
  after the cache tier has almost lapsed, the plugin sends one request over a
  **fork** of the session. The fork shares the session's model, agent, tools and
  system prompt, so its prefix is byte-identical and only appends: the provider
  answers from cache and the TTL refreshes. No heartbeat messages ever enter the
  real conversation. `/keepwarm off` stops it for the session and turns the
  default off.
- **`/ember guard warn` (default) shows the price and sends anyway.** When the TTL has
  lapsed and the context is large, a graceful warning is shown while the message sends.
  `/ember guard refuse` hard blocks cold sends and shows an informative error in the turn,
  preventing accidental rewrites until you switch to `warn` or `/clear`.
- **`/ember` keeps score.** Warm or cold, context size, cold-rewrite price, the
  break-even (how many pings cost one cold write, and the idle that covers),
  keepwarm state, guard mode, and this session's cold writes.
- **`ember gain` reports history.** Every warm heartbeat and every paid cold
  write is bucketed per day (kept warm for up to 90 days), and the `ember gain`
  terminal binary reports total heartbeats, tokens kept warm, the kept-warm
  value against ping spend and realized cold writes, net savings, a
  warming-yield meter, and a per-day impact table — in the spirit of `rtk gain`.
  `ember discover` is an alias; `ember gain --json` dumps the raw buckets.

## Requirements

- [opencode](https://opencode.ai) (server plugins, `chat.message` +
  `command.execute.before` hooks; tested on 1.18.x).
- A provider with prefix caching. Anthropic is the best-supported; pricing
  tables for Fable/Opus/Sonnet/Haiku are built in.

## Install

### From this repo (recommended)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ozandogrultan/opencode-ember.git
cd opencode-ember
./install.sh
```

Then **restart opencode** — plugins are loaded at startup only.

`install.sh` also links the report binary as `~/.local/bin/ember` (set
`EMBER_BIN_DIR` to choose another directory), so `ember gain` works from any
shell. It requires [`bun`](https://bun.sh) on PATH; an alternative is
`npm install -g .` from the repo, or copy `gain.ts` somewhere on your PATH.
`/ember gain` inside opencode tells you to use the binary instead.

`install.sh` asks opencode for its own config directory (`opencode debug paths`)
and copies `ember.ts` into `<config>/plugins/`, backing up any existing file.

### Manually

Copy `ember.ts` to one of:

- `~/.config/opencode/plugins/ember.ts` — all projects (global)
- `<project>/.opencode/plugins/ember.ts` — one project

### From npm

```json
{ "plugin": ["opencode-ember"] }
```

in `opencode.json`, then restart opencode.

## Usage

```
/keepwarm [6h|90m] [every 2m] [ttl 1h] | always | status | off
/ember [guard warn|refuse]
ember gain | discover [--json]     # the report, from any shell
```

| command | effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/keepwarm` | refresh always-on warming (or arm six hours if the default is off) |
| `/keepwarm 90m` | a window of your own (`2h30m`, `6h`, …) |
| `/keepwarm always` | keep this and future sessions armed until closed (already the default) |
| `/keepwarm 6h every 2m` | override the ping period (floor 1m) |
| `/keepwarm 6h ttl 1h` | assume the 1-hour cache tier |
| `/keepwarm status` | the status line |
| `/keepwarm off` | stop, forget the window, turn the default off |
| `/ember` | the card |
| `/ember guard warn` | show the price and send (default) |
| `/ember guard refuse` | hard block cold sends |
| `ember gain` | terminal report over collected history (alias `ember discover`) |

Warming belongs to each session. By default it renews as long as opencode is
running; explicitly timed windows end after their duration. A second session
gets its own timer, and a resumed session restores its setting. A session
resumed after the cache tier already expired cannot be rescued retroactively:
its first turn is cold by definition, and warming resumes from that point. Run
`/keepwarm off` to disable the default and warm only on request.

## The 5-minute tier (read this)

opencode marks `cache_control` **without a `ttl`**, i.e. the **5-minute** tier,
so pings land at ~4 minutes, not the original mod's 50. If your provider
actually holds an hour, run `/keepwarm 6h ttl 1h` (or set
`EMBER_TTL_SECONDS=3600`) for a ~54-minute cadence.

Economically that matters: on a 200k-token context a cache read is ~$0.05 and a
cold write ~$4, so ~80 pings cost one cold write. Warm a one-hour break and you
win; warm a whole working day on the 5-minute tier and you are near break-even.

Always-on warming can keep paying for cache reads beyond six hours while the
session remains open. Turn it off with `/keepwarm off` or use an explicit
duration if you would rather bound the cost per session.

## It will not invalidate your cache

- Pings reuse the session's **exact** model, agent, tools and system prompt and
  send a constant one-line prompt. They only append.
- After every ping the plugin checks the usage: if it wrote at least a tenth of
  what it read, it concludes the cache was already gone and **stops itself**
  rather than hammering a cold cache. A ping that reports no cache numbers at
  all is treated as inconclusive instead: it retries once and stops only after
  two consecutive zero-activity readbacks, so one flaky usage report cannot
  kill the heartbeat. A transient ping error also retries once before stopping.
- Pings only run while the last request is still inside the cache tier. A
  session resumed after the tier expired (process restart, sleep, long break)
  waits for your next turn instead of cold-rewriting the fork itself.
- An explicitly timed window expires without editing or clearing the session.

## Configuration

| env var | default | meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `EMBER_TTL_SECONDS` | `300` | assumed cache tier |
| `EMBER_MIN_CONTEXT` | `50000` | cold-guard context floor, tokens |
| `EMBER_MIN_PING_SECONDS` | `60` | ping floor |

## Prices and the reporting caveats (read this too)

Dollar figures come from a small built-in table in `ember.ts` (`PRICES`: cache
read, cache write and output rates per model family). Two consequences:

- **Every figure is an estimate.** Prices are hard-coded list rates for the
  Anthropic/OpenAI families the plugin knows; they do not follow your provider,
  plan, negotiated rates, or prompt-fee changes. Treat every dollar value in
  `/ember` and `/ember gain` as an approximation, not an invoice.
- **Unpriced models read $0.00.** Models without a matching row — e.g. custom
  OpenAI-compatible ids like `gpt-5.5` or provider relays — report no cost, so
  the kept-warm value, ping spend, cold-write cost, net savings and the warming
  yield meter all run understated (or read $0.00) for them. Raw counters —
  heartbeat counts, tokens kept warm, idle time held warm, cold-write counts —
  stay accurate regardless. Add a row to `PRICES` in `ember.ts` if you want
  dollar accuracy for such a model.

State lives in `~/.local/share/opencode/ember.json` and is stamped with a
version. Multiple opencode processes (one per workspace/cmux session) share the
file: every write re-reads it and merges, so a process writing its own session's
window never drops sessions armed elsewhere. Heartbeat and cold-write history is
bucketed per day and trimmed to the last 90 days for `/ember gain`. A state file
written before warming was on by default is upgraded silently: its `always:
false` was the old default rather than a choice, so it is ignored once and the
new default applies. Delete the file to reset.

## Testing

Free (no model call):

```sh
opencode debug config | grep -A2 -E '"keepwarm"|"ember"'   # loaded?
```

```
/keepwarm status     # "keepwarm off"
/keepwarm 6h         # arms
/ember               # card
/ember guard warn    # switch guard
ember gain           # the report (CLI)
/keepwarm off
```

Cold guard, for about one small call — launch with a 5-second pseudo-TTL and a
1-token floor, send a message, wait 6s, send another (blocked):

```sh
EMBER_TTL_SECONDS=5 EMBER_MIN_CONTEXT=1 opencode
```

Prove a ping shares the cache (one cache read) — in a warm session with real
context:

```
/keepwarm 1h every 1m
```

Wait a minute, then run `/ember`. Its last-ping cache read should be close to
your context size: that is the proof the fork hit the main cache. Successful
pings are silent; failures and stops still show a toast. If the ping reports
no cache activity, the provider may not cache this prefix or report cache
usage, so keepwarm stops rather than paying for unverified pings. Stop notices
appear briefly in the TUI (five seconds); `/keepwarm status` or `/ember` shows
the reason afterward.

## How it works

`chat.message` + `chat.params` (cold guard), `event` (token/price tracking, timers) and
`command.execute.before` (the two commands, aborted before any model call).
Pings go through `session.fork` → `session.prompt` → `session.delete`.
