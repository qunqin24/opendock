## Registry

The canonical source of truth for all integrations is [`integrations.json`](integrations.json). Capabilities, install commands, transport, tool naming, thread save methods, and the user-facing autonomy contract are tracked there. Update the registry first when adding or modifying integrations.

The autonomy contract uses one shared language across integrations:

- `automatic`: the host/plugin enforces it through hooks or lifecycle wiring
- `guided`: the package/rules/skills strongly teach it, but the model still decides
- `manual`: it only happens when the user or agent asks directly

This keeps one critical distinction honest for fresh users: having tools available is not the same thing as getting autonomous memory behavior.

For behavioral guidance (when to read Context Bundle, use Working Memory fallback, search, save, and route ambient spaces), see [`shared/behavioral-guidance.md`](shared/behavioral-guidance.md). For plugin authoring rules, see [`docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).

For end-user customization that survives updates, see [`docs/USER_OVERRIDE_GUIDE.md`](docs/USER_OVERRIDE_GUIDE.md). The short version: do not edit installed plugin files; use the host's own instruction files when that host supports them.

For multi-agent orchestrators that launch Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, or other
child CLIs, set `NMEM_AGENT_ID=<agent-slug>` in each child process. Add
`NMEM_SPACE=<space>` only when that run should override the AI Identity's
default space. `NMEM_HOST_AGENT_ID` is for advanced external aliases, not a
second required identity variable. The child plugin still reports its real
runtime as `source_app`; the env var selects the right Nowledge AI Identity
through Context Bundle.

## Community Linux packages

The official Linux release channels remain the APT repository, `.deb`,
AppImage, and Docker paths documented at
[mem.nowledge.co/docs/installation](https://mem.nowledge.co/docs/installation).
The packages below are maintained by community contributors for users who
prefer their distro's native package manager. Review the package metadata or
PKGBUILD before installing, as you would for any community-maintained package.

Each directory is a standalone integration. Pick the one that matches your tool.

| Integration | Install | What it does |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| **[Universal Agent Plugin](nowledge-mem-agent-plugin)** | Install this source directory from an Agent Plugins-compatible client | Standards-compatible fallback for clients that support Agent Plugins but do not have a dedicated Nowledge connector yet.

| **[MCP](#direct-mcp)** | For tools without a dedicated Nowledge package, use [direct MCP](#direct-mcp). | Standard memory and thread tools exposed through one shared MCP server. |

## Direct MCP

Add to your tool's MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nowledge-mem": {
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:14242/mcp/",
      "type": "streamableHttp"
    }
  }
}
```

See [mcp.json](mcp.json) for the reference config.

For remote Mem, configure this machine once with `nmem config client set url ...` and `nmem config client set api-key ...`, then generate the exact host config:

```bash
nmem config mcp show --host cursor
nmem config mcp show --host codex
nmem config mcp show --host gemini-cli
nmem config mcp show --host craft-agent
nmem config mcp show --host codebuddy
nmem config mcp show --host cindy
nmem config mcp show --host zcode
nmem config mcp show --host deepseek-harness
```

Direct MCP clients do not read `~/.nowledge-mem/config.json` automatically; paste the generated block into the host's own MCP settings.

## Requirements

- [Nowledge Mem](https://mem.nowledge.co) running locally
- `nmem` CLI on your PATH: if Mem is running on the same machine, install it from **Settings > Preferences > Developer Tools > Install CLI** in the app, use `pip install nmem-cli` for a standalone setup, or on Arch Linux install the [`nmem-cli` AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nmem-cli) with `yay -S nmem-cli` or `paru -S nmem-cli`

```bash
nmem status   # verify Nowledge Mem is running
```

## Spaces

Spaces are optional. Most integrations can stay on `Default` and never mention them.

If a host already has its own profile or provider config, choose the lane there first:

- plugin/provider setting such as `space = "Research Agent"`
- a derived mapping such as `spaceTemplate = "agent-${AGENT_NAME}"`
- an exact identity map such as `space_by_identity = {"research":"Research Agent"}`

Use `NMEM_SPACE="Research Agent"` only for CLI-first hosts or runtimes that do not expose a better config surface. HTTP- or MCP-based integrations should pass `space_id` explicitly when their host/runtime can do so. The storage boundary is still one hidden shared key, but humans and agents should normally work with the space name instead. Legacy `NMEM_SPACE_ID` still works for older setups.

For agent harnesses, the rule is simple:

- If the host can only promise one lane per process or profile, support one fixed ambient space.
- If the host exposes a stable identity or workspace signal, support a derived mapping (`spaceTemplate` or exact identity mapping).
- If the host does not expose identity cleanly, do not fake per-agent routing.

### Space behavior by integration

Use one ambient space only when the host already has a real lane, such as one AI Identity, one project, or one workspace.

| Integration | Ambient space today | Best user setup |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Claude Code, Grok, Codex, Droid, Pi, Gemini CLI, DeepSeek Harness | Full ambient lane through `NMEM_SPACE` or per-command `--space` | Set one `NMEM_SPACE` only when the whole session truly belongs to one lane. Otherwise stay on `Default`. |
| Hermes | Full ambient lane through provider `space`, `space_by_identity`, `space_template`, or fallback `NMEM_SPACE` | Use `space` for one stable lane, `space_by_identity` for a small explicit map, `space_template` for one lane per Hermes identity. |
| Alma | Full ambient lane through plugin `nowledgeMem.space`, plugin `nowledgeMem.spaceTemplate`, or fallback `NMEM_SPACE` | Use `space` for one Alma profile per lane. Use `spaceTemplate` only when your launcher already exports a trustworthy lane variable. |
| Bub | Full ambient lane through `NMEM_SPACE` | Treat Bub as one process-wide lane. If you need separate lanes, run separate Bub processes or profiles. |
| OpenClaw | Full ambient lane through plugin `space`, plugin `spaceTemplate`, or fallback `NMEM_SPACE`, preserved across CLI memory calls and API-backed thread/feed paths | Use `space` for one stable profile. Use `spaceTemplate` only when the launcher already exports the lane signal. Do not fake per-agent routing if the runtime does not expose identity. |
| OpenCode | Full ambient lane through `NMEM_SPACE`, preserved across CLI memory calls and HTTP session save | Set one `NMEM_SPACE` when the OpenCode process belongs to one real lane. |
| Craft Agent | Partial today | MCP source calls use the configured Mem endpoint. `nmem t save/sync --from craft-agent` can use `--space` or `NMEM_SPACE` for imports; keep one lane only when the Craft workspace represents one real lane. |
| Cursor | Partial today | `sessionStart` and handoff flows can follow `NMEM_SPACE`, but MCP tool calls still need Cursor/runtime support to forward `space_id`. |
| Raycast | One fixed lane through Raycast preferences or shared config | Use one named space when that launcher profile always belongs to one lane. Leave it empty to stay on `Default`. |
| Browser extension | One fixed lane through extension settings | Use one named space when that browser profile always belongs to one lane. Leave it empty to stay on `Default`. |
| Generic MCP-only hosts | Usually default lane only today | Keep using `Default` unless the host can explicitly pass `space_id`. |

What the space profile means is the same everywhere:

- **When this space searches** decides how far automatic recall expands before the agent starts answering.
- **Also search these spaces** adds reusable context lanes for retrieval only. It does not move or merge records.
- **Agent guidance** is read by AI Now and built-in/background agents working in that lane. It changes retrieval and explanation style, not storage.
