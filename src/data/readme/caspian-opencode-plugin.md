Caspian is an **agent communication** SDK. Your agent's reasoning decides **what** to say; Caspian is **how it exists** on **Slack, Discord, GitHub, Telegram, Instagram, email, X, Bluesky**, and beyond — one connect call per channel, one handler for all of them, threading, webhook verification, and platform quirks handled.

Most agent communication work is agent-to-human, not agent-to-agent. Protocols like A2A and ACP connect agents to each other; Caspian connects your agent to the people it works for, on the channels they already use.

## Get started in 30 seconds

**Building in a coding agent** (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Kimi, …)? Paste this — it reads the live guide and does the whole integration for you:

```text
Integrate Caspian so my agent can message people on email, Slack, Discord, Telegram, and more.
Read https://api.trycaspianai.com/SKILL.md and follow it end to end.
```

That's the fastest path — the guide at [`/SKILL.md`](https://api.trycaspianai.com/SKILL.md) is always current, so your agent installs the SDK, mints a key, connects a channel, and writes the handler itself.

**Or set it up by hand:**

```bash
cd your-project
pip install caspian-sdk        # the library (import into your code)
pipx install caspian-cli       # the CLI (gives the `caspian` command) — or: uvx caspian-cli
caspian init                   # mints a key, writes CASPIAN_API_KEY + CASPIAN_BASE_URL to .env
caspian connect email          # free, instant
```

Then in your code:

```python
from caspian_sdk import CommClient

client = CommClient()  # reads CASPIAN_API_KEY / CASPIAN_BASE_URL from .env
email = client.connect_email(username="example-agent")
print(f"Agent email: {email['address']}")
print("Listening (Ctrl+C to stop).")


@client.on_message
def handle(message):
    sender = (message.sender or {}).get("address", "?")
    print(f"<- {sender}: {message.text!r}")
    message.reply(f"You said: {message.text}")


client.listen()  # one loop, every channel
```

> **Node / TypeScript:** the library is `npm install caspian-sdk`. The `caspian` CLI is a
> standalone tool (Python) — run it with `uvx caspian-cli init` / `pipx install caspian-cli`,
> or just use the SDK directly (below); nothing else about the flow changes.

The SDK talks to the **hosted gateway at `https://api.trycaspianai.com`** by default (set `CASPIAN_BASE_URL` to point at a self-hosted one). **Free channels — email, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Bluesky — connect instantly, no sign-in.** Paid channels (X, WhatsApp, iMessage) prompt a one-time developer sign-in (`caspian login`, or `client.login()`) and run on prepaid credit you add in the dashboard.

> **Hosted channels (Beta):** Google Meet voice — put your agent into a live Google Meet call as a real-time voice participant. Available on the managed gateway; see [`/SKILL.md`](https://api.trycaspianai.com/SKILL.md).

**TypeScript** — same contract, zero runtime dependencies:

```ts
import { CommClient } from "caspian-sdk";

const client = new CommClient();  // reads CASPIAN_API_KEY / CASPIAN_BASE_URL
const inbox = await client.connectEmail({ username: "my-agent" });

client.onMessage(async (message) => {
  await message.reply(`You said: ${message.text}`);
});

await client.listen();
```

Adding a channel is one more `connect_*()` call — never new handler code.

## The problem

Every agent team ends up rebuilding the same four things — and none of them make the agent smarter.

**1. You own infrastructure you never wanted.** Writing the Slack bot is a weekend; owning it is forever. Session/auth desync, reconnect loops, silent connection failures, payload changes on every platform version bump. The pain isn't `send()` — sending is a solved call. The pain is the **lifecycle**. The largest OSS agent frameworks each maintain 25+ channel adapters in-tree and still spend 8–15% of their issue trackers on channel plumbing. (We measured 42 open-source agent projects before writing a line of this code.)

**2. Communication isn't part of your agent's decision-making.** With one-off, per-channel integrations, a developer decided at build time where and how the agent talks. The agent itself can't reason *"this deserves a quick Telegram ping now and an email summary afterwards"* — each channel is a separate bot with separate code and a separate identity. Communication stays hardcoded plumbing instead of becoming a capability the model can actually decide with.

**3. You maintain N identities for every one person.** The same human DMs your agent on Instagram today and emails it tomorrow. Now *your* database needs its own concept of "this is one person, one relationship, one running conversation" — who said what on which channel, and what should happen next in the flow. Every team rebuilds that continuity layer from scratch, per app, and it never stops needing care.

**4. A single-channel agent is a competitive disadvantage.** If a competing agent is reachable on five channels and yours on one, users go where they get answered. The open-source numbers show it: the agents people actually rely on are exactly the ones deployed across dozens of human channels — and that reach is exactly where their engineering time goes.

## Caspian's answer

**Channels are transports, not identities.** The agent is one identity; every channel binds to it through the same small adapter interface, and your handler code never learns which platform it's on. Messages arrive in one normalized conversation/message model regardless of transport, threading is owned by the layer, and `message.reply()` always answers in the right place — so cross-channel continuity lives in one place instead of five databases. Per-channel etiquette comes from `client.behavior_prompt()`, so *how to talk where* becomes something your model reasons about, not something you hardcode.

<summary><b>* The fine print</b> — read before you promise features</summary>
<br/>

- **X is not free**: DM send/receive needs a paid X API subscription on your X developer app (the free tier is write-only and capped).
- **Telegram user-account automation is ToS-gray**: it drives a personal account over MTProto and requires explicit opt-in config; bans are your risk. Never for spam.
- **GSM modem SMS**: your own modem + SIM; carrier compliance (A2P rules) is on you.

</details>

## Where to use it

If your agent needs to talk to humans, this is the layer under it:

- **Customer support agents** — answer on email, Slack, Instagram DM, or wherever the customer opened the thread; hand off to a human without dropping context.
- **Sales & lead follow-up** — first touch on the channel the lead used, follow-ups where they actually respond.
- **Personal / executive assistants** — one assistant identity across your email, Telegram, and Slack instead of three disconnected bots.
- **Community & product bots** — the same agent in your Discord, your Slack community, and members' DMs.
- **OpenClaw agents** — `clawhub install @trycaspian/caspian` ([the skill](./packages/clawhub-skill)) teaches your agent to wire itself up; [`openclaw-caspian`](./packages/openclaw) is the native channel plugin.
- **OpenCode agents** — [`caspian-opencode-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/caspian-opencode-plugin) bridges Caspian email / Telegram / Discord into OpenCode sessions:

  ```bash
  bunx caspian-opencode-plugin setup   # or: setup --project
  # restart OpenCode
  ```

  Details: [`packages/opencode`](./packages/opencode).
- **Fleets** — multi-tenant scoping gives each customer their own agent identity (see the recipe below).

Each of these is the same three lines: `connect_*()` the channels, write one `on_message` handler, `listen()`. Start from a [runnable example](./examples).

## Recipes

**Same agent, three channels:**

```python
client.connect_email(username="acme-support")
client.connect_telegram(bot_token=BOT_TOKEN)
slack = client.install_slack(display_name="Acme Support")
print("Add to Slack:", slack["authorize_url"])   # one click, then it's live
# the @client.on_message handler you already wrote now answers on all three
```

**Platform-aware replies** — teach the agent each channel's etiquette in one line:

```python
system_prompt += "\n\n" + client.behavior_prompt()
```

<details>
<summary><b>Multi-tenant</b> — one agent per customer, isolated by scope</summary>

```python
acme = client.create_customer("Acme")
agent = client.create_agent("Support")
client.connect_slack(customer_id=acme["id"], agent_id=agent["id"], ...)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Adapters without the SDK</b> — use the channel layer directly</summary>

```python
from caspian_adapters import Settings, build_providers

providers = build_providers(Settings(
    providers="instagram",
    instagram_page_id="<page id>",
    instagram_access_token="<page token>",
    instagram_app_secret="<app secret>",
))
```

</details>

## Rich messages

Send **one** provider-neutral `blocks` payload and every channel gets its best
possible rendering: Slack (Block Kit), Discord (embeds + buttons) and Telegram
(inline keyboards) render it natively, email gets rich HTML, and every text-only
channel (SMS, voice, and the rest) degrades to clean, readable text — automatically.
No per-channel branching in your handler.

A block is a plain dict/object (`{ "type": ... }`): `heading`, `text`, `divider`,
`image`, `fields`, `list`, `buttons`, `card`. A button with a `url` is a link; a
button with a `value` is a callback that renders as a tappable action where the
channel supports it, and as a "reply …" hint where it doesn't.

**Python:**

```python
from caspian_sdk import blocks as b

message.reply(blocks=[
    b.card(
        title="Order #1024 shipped",
        subtitle="Arriving Thursday",
        text="Your package is on the way.",
        buttons=[
            {"label": "Track package", "url": "https://example.com/track/1024"},
            {"label": "Get help", "value": "help:1024"},   # callback
        ],
    ),
])
```

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
import type { Block } from "caspian-sdk";

const blocks: Block[] = [
  {
    type: "card",
    title: "Order #1024 shipped",
    subtitle: "Arriving Thursday",
    text: "Your package is on the way.",
    buttons: [
      { label: "Track package", url: "https://example.com/track/1024" },
      { label: "Get help", value: "help:1024" }, // callback
    ],
  },
];

await message.reply(undefined, undefined, blocks);
// or proactively: await client.sendMessage(conversationId, null, null, blocks);
```

Blocks work anywhere text does — `message.reply(...)`, `send_message(...)` /
`sendMessage(...)`. Pass `text` too and it's used as the fallback on channels
that can't render blocks; omit it and a clean text fallback is generated for you.
