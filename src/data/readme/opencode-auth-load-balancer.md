# opencode-auth-load-balancer

Load-balance [opencode](https://opencode.ai) across **multiple Claude (Anthropic) and Codex (OpenAI/ChatGPT) OAuth accounts** so you never have to stop and re-login when one account runs out of quota.

Selection is **not** round-robin. It is weighted primarily by **weekly** usage, with a continuous "drain the soonest-resetting account first" rule, per-conversation **session affinity** (to preserve prompt caching), and a proactive switch **before** an account hits 100%.

---

## Features

- **Account pool** — register many Claude / Codex OAuth accounts; the plugin manages and rotates them.
- **Weekly-usage-weighted scheduling** — `urgency = weeklyRemaining / daysUntilWeeklyReset`. A sooner reset (e.g. 3 days) outranks a later one (7 days) at equal headroom; perishable quota is drained progressively, never crammed into the final hour.
- **Automatic rotation** — on `429`/auth errors an account is cooled down and the next-best is tried; `retry-after` is honored.
- **Model-tier fallback ladder (Fable, Opus, …)** — Claude Max accounts have *separate* weekly caps per premium model tier. When one is exhausted (a 429 whose `representative-claim` names a tier window, e.g. `seven_day_fable` / `seven_day_opus`), the balancer records a **per-tier** cooldown instead of cooling the whole account down (which used to cascade every account into a false "cooldown" and block *every* model on it). Requests for that tier then **steer to an account with tier headroom** — keeping the model you asked for — and only when the *whole pool* is tier-limited does the request descend **one rung down the fallback ladder**: the next model family in `fable → opus → sonnet → haiku` (order configurable via `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_ANTHROPIC_FAMILY_ORDER`), picking the **highest-versioned model your provider config actually has** (a capped `claude-fable-5` prefers `claude-opus-4-9` over `claude-opus-4-8`). If that tier is capped too, it descends again (`fable → opus → sonnet`), each step toasted, preferably on the session's pinned account (keeping its prompt cache). Pin a fixed target or disable entirely via `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_ANTHROPIC_OPUS_FALLBACK_MODEL`.
- **Durable provider pending** — after model fallback and account rotation are exhausted, a session-bound turn whose whole provider is blocked by account-wide quota stays pending without sending a guaranteed `429`. It resumes when capacity returns, survives an opencode restart as the same user message, and is removed immediately when you cancel with `Esc`. Sessions wait and resume independently; there is no provider-wide FIFO.
- **Self-updating Claude Code version** — Anthropic gates new models on the client version the request claims, so a pinned version stops working the day a model ships (`Claude Code 2.1.87 does not support this model; version 2.1.251 or newer is required`). The plugin discovers the current version from npm instead, caches it for a day, and never regresses below a version known to work. See [Claude Code version](#claude-code-version).
- **Session affinity** — a conversation stays pinned to one account so you keep its prompt cache and don't re-send context on every turn.
- **Proactive migration** — leaves an account at a configurable soft threshold (~95%) instead of waiting for a hard 100% wall (which can break in-flight subagents).
- **Single-use refresh-token safety** — per-account singleflight refresh; rotated tokens are persisted immediately.
- **Visibility** — toasts for account switches, model fallback, pending/recovery, and restart restoration; an on-demand `auth_lb_status` tool; and a `bun run status` CLI dashboard.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.com) ≥ 1.3
- opencode (TUI), with the Anthropic and/or OpenAI providers available

---

## Install & build

```bash
bun install
bun run build      # → dist/index.js (a single self-contained file)
```

The bundle imports only Node built-ins, so it can be dropped into opencode as one file.

### Load it into opencode (local / dev)

opencode auto-loads any `.ts`/`.js` file in a **plugins directory**:

- `.opencode/plugins/` — project-level (recommended; unambiguous on every OS)
- `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` — global

Copy or symlink the built bundle into your opencode project's plugin dir:

```bash
# macOS / Linux — symlink so rebuilds are picked up automatically
mkdir -p .opencode/plugins
ln -sf "$(pwd)/dist/index.js" .opencode/plugins/auth-load-balancer.js
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell) — copy (symlinks need Developer Mode / admin)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path .opencode\plugins | Out-Null
Copy-Item dist\index.js .opencode\plugins\auth-load-balancer.js
```

Restart opencode to load it. (opencode does **not** hot-reload plugins — see the dev loop below.)

### Install it from npm (once published)

```jsonc
// opencode.json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-auth-load-balancer"]
}
```

opencode installs the package and its dependencies automatically at startup.

---

## Register your accounts

Run opencode's auth flow once **per account**:

1. `opencode auth login`
2. Choose **"Claude Pro/Max (add account to load balancer)"** (or **"ChatGPT/Codex …"**).
3. Open the URL, authorize, and paste the resulting code/URL back.
4. Repeat for every account you want in the pool.

Each login **appends** to the pool (it does not overwrite opencode's single auth slot). If you already logged in with the upstream `opencode-anthropic-auth` plugin, that credential is imported automatically on first run.

The pool lives in a JSON file you can inspect/edit (e.g. to rename labels):

| When | Path |
|------|------|
| Default (**every** OS, incl. Windows) | `~/.local/share/opencode/auth-load-balancer.json` |
| `$XDG_DATA_HOME` set | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode/auth-load-balancer.json` |

opencode resolves its data dir via `xdg-basedir`, which is platform-agnostic — it does **not** use `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows or `Application Support` on macOS (verified with `opencode debug paths`).

Durable turn references live beside the pool as `auth-load-balancer-pending.json`. This file contains only workspace/provider/session/message ids and scheduling timestamps — never prompt text, request bodies, attachments, headers, OAuth tokens, or provider responses. Both files use atomic writes and cross-process locks.

A third file, `auth-load-balancer-cc-version.json`, caches the discovered Claude Code version (`{"version","fetchedAt"}` — see [Claude Code version](#claude-code-version)). It holds no account data and is safe to delete; it is rebuilt on the next start.

> **OpenAI/Codex note:** the OpenAI path assumes opencode is configured to use the **Responses API** (the standard ChatGPT/Codex setup); `/responses` requests are routed to the Codex backend.

---

## See which account is in use

Three surfaces, in increasing detail:

1. **Toast on switch** — when the in-use account changes, opencode shows a toast: `Claude account ▶ claude-work · weekly 45% · 5h 10%`.
2. **`auth_lb_status` tool** — ask the agent to "show auth load balancer status"; it prints the full dashboard in chat.
3. **CLI** — run it directly in a terminal:

```bash
bun run status
```

```text
Claude — in use: claude-personal
  #  account            weekly   5h   resets   state
  1    claude-work        45%   10%    2d2h  ready
  2  ▶ claude-personal    72%   38%    1d6h  in use
  3    claude-burner     100%     -     30m  exhausted

Codex — in use: chatgpt-plus
  #  account            weekly   5h   resets   state
  1  ▶ chatgpt-plus       20%    5%   3d18h  in use
```

The workspace-aware `auth_lb_status` tool also appends durable waits; the standalone TUI layout remains unchanged:

```text
Pending turns
  Claude  2 sessions · nearest recovery 3h0m
  Codex   1 session · checking again 5m
```

`▶` marks the in-use account; `#` is the rank the scheduler would pick next.

### Persistent bottom status bar (TUI)

A SolidJS TUI plugin renders a persistent bottom status bar (opencode's always-visible `app_bottom` slot) showing both the in-use account(s) per provider (polled from the pool, e.g. `Claude anthropic-1 58% · 5h 12%`) **and** the current session usage — tokens, % of the model context window, and `$` cost — computed the same way opencode's own footer does. It is **four files**:

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| [`tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.ts`](tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.ts) | Plugin **entry** (no JSX). Registered in `tui.json` (below). Inside `tui()` it **lazily** imports the view. |
| [`tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.view.tsx`](tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.view.tsx) | The SolidJS **view** (JSX). Compiled by opencode's TUI runtime Solid transform, whose loader matches `*.{tsx,jsx}`. |
| [`tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.logic.ts`](tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.logic.ts) | Pure, non-JSX pool-file logic (read/normalize the pool file, the sidebar's rename/delete mutations, and the `pct`/`until`/`winPct`/`tierResets`/`stateOf` display-formatting helpers) split out of the view so it's directly unit-testable, imported unchanged by `.view.tsx`. |
| [`tui/auth-load-balancer-scoring.ts`](tui/auth-load-balancer-scoring.ts) | A byte-identical copy of [`src/scheduler/score-core.ts`](src/scheduler/score-core.ts) (kept in sync by `bun run build` + a test) so the dashboard ranks accounts with the **exact same** scorer as the server — never a drifting re-implementation. |

Install the four files into a directory the **server does not scan** (anything other than `plugin/` / `plugins/`) and register the entry in `tui.json`:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/tui-plugins
cp tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.ts tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.view.tsx tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.logic.ts tui/auth-load-balancer-scoring.ts ~/.config/opencode/tui-plugins/
```

```powershell
# Windows
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\tui-plugins | Out-Null
Copy-Item tui\auth-load-balancer-tui.ts,tui\auth-load-balancer-tui.view.tsx,tui\auth-load-balancer-tui.logic.ts,tui\auth-load-balancer-scoring.ts $env:USERPROFILE\.config\opencode\tui-plugins\
```

Then register the entry in `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` (this is how opencode loads TUI plugins) and restart:

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": [
    "file:///absolute/path/to/.config/opencode/tui-plugins/auth-load-balancer-tui.ts"
  ]
}
```

> **Why this shape (it matters):** TUI plugins load from the `plugin` array in `tui.json`, **not** from the server's plugins-dir glob. The server *separately* globs `{plugin,plugins}/*.{ts,js}` and loads every match as a **server** plugin — so a TUI entry dropped in `plugins/` is also loaded by the server, rejected (`must default export … server()`), and logs an error on **every** launch (and a stray scoring `.ts` there would be mis-loaded as a plugin and break provider resolution). Keeping the four files OUTSIDE `plugins/` and registering only via `tui.json` avoids that. The split into a `.ts` **entry** that **lazily imports** a `.tsx` **view** is still required because opencode's runtime SolidJS JSX transform (`@opentui/solid`) only matches `*.{tsx,jsx}` — a `.ts` cannot itself contain JSX, and the lazy import keeps the server plugin worker (which never runs `tui()`) from evaluating the SolidJS module graph. Developed against opencode / `@opencode-ai/plugin` `>=1.18.26` + `@opentui/solid` `0.5.10` (the versions currently pinned in `package.json`). The `.tsx` view **is** typechecked (`tsconfig.tui.json`) and linted here — its JSX deps (`solid-js` + `@opentui/*`) are installed as devDependencies pinned to those versions — so type/import/prop breaks are caught in CI; only its runtime rendering still needs a live opencode TUI to verify. The toast + `auth_lb_status` tool + `bun run status` CLI cover the same information regardless. (`auth-load-balancer-tui.logic.ts` has no JSX and no TUI-runtime dependency, so it is directly unit-tested rather than only typechecked.)

## Configuration

All knobs are environment variables with sane defaults.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_HOURLY_INFLUENCE` | `0.5` | How much 5h headroom modulates the weekly-urgency score (0–1). |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_MIN_RESET_MS` | `300000` | Floor on time-to-reset (caps urgency near a reset). |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_WEEK_WINDOW_MS` | `604800000` | Baseline horizon used when a weekly reset time is unknown. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_EXHAUSTED_AT` | `0.999` | Hard exhaustion: at/above this utilization an account is excluded. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_MIGRATE_AT` | `0.95` | Soft threshold to proactively leave a pinned account (before 100%). |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_WEEKLY_DRAIN_TARGET` | `0.98` | Soft threshold for the WEEKLY window: scoring treats weekly quota as "fully drained" past this utilization, and a pinned session proactively migrates once its weekly util crosses it. The 5h window uses `MIGRATE_AT` (~0.95); the weekly window uses this (~0.98). Must be in (`MIGRATE_AT`, `EXHAUSTED_AT`]. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_CHEAP_SWITCH_MAX_BYTES` | `65536` | For non-forced (proactive/drain) switches, only switch when the request body ≤ this many bytes, so a grown conversation isn't re-sent onto a fresh (uncached) account — a full per-account prompt-cache write. `0` disables the gate (always switch). A proactive switch bypasses this gate when the pinned account is within ~1% of hard exhaustion (a forced switch is imminent anyway and the context only grows); forced switches always ignore it. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_DRAIN_MIGRATE` | `false` | Allow switching a healthy session to drain another account whose weekly window is about to reset. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_DRAIN_MIGRATE_MARGIN` | `1.5` | Urgency factor required to justify a drain switch. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_SESSION_TTL_MS` | `21600000` | Session→account assignments older than this are pruned. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_MAX_WAIT_MS` | `305000` | Bounded wait for requests that do **not** carry both an opencode session id and user-message id (provider-internal or external fetches). Session-bound user turns use durable pending instead and wait until provider quota recovers or the user cancels. Auth (`401`/`403`), disabled/re-login accounts, and network failures are never converted into quota waits. `0` makes anonymous requests fail fast. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_ANTHROPIC_OPUS_FALLBACK_MODEL` | *(unset — ladder mode)* | Claude Max accounts have **separate weekly caps per premium model tier** (Fable, Opus, …). When one is exhausted, that tier's requests 429 (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-representative-claim: seven_day_fable` / `seven_day_opus` / …) even though the account's aggregate 5h/7d windows still have headroom and every other model works. Instead of cooling the **whole account** down (which cascaded every account into "cooldown"), the balancer records a **per-tier** cooldown: requests for that tier steer to accounts with tier headroom, and once the whole pool is tier-limited they descend the **fallback ladder** (next family down, best version in your provider's model list; toasted, never silent). **Unset** = ladder mode (recommended). Set to a **model id** to pin a fixed downgrade target (bypassing the ladder). Set to an **empty string** to disable (revert to the account-wide cooldown). The env name keeps `OPUS` for compatibility but applies to **every** tier. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_ANTHROPIC_FAMILY_ORDER` | `fable,opus,sonnet,haiku` | The fallback ladder's model families, **best first**. A tier-capped request downgrades to the highest-versioned configured model of the next family below the capped one (e.g. capped `fable` → newest `opus`; capped `opus` → newest `sonnet`). A family not in the list (a future top tier) is treated as above the first entry — so when Anthropic ships a new premium tier, a config tweak (or nothing at all, if it slots on top) keeps the ladder correct without a code change. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` | *(unset — auto)* | Pin the Claude Code version the plugin claims to be, bypassing both the npm lookup and the built-in floor. Anthropic **gates new models on this version** — asking for a model newer than the version you report is rejected with `claude_code_version_too_old` — so by default the plugin resolves it automatically (see [Claude Code version](#claude-code-version)). Set this only to pin **forward** (a version npm hasn't tagged `latest` yet) or **back** (to reproduce a failure, or if a future release changes the request fingerprint and the newest version starts failing). Must be a plain `x.y.z`; anything else is ignored. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_DIR` | — | Override the pool-file directory (handy for tests). |
| `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_DEBUG` | — | `1`/`true` logs each selection to stderr. |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | — | Route Anthropic requests through a custom base URL. |

### Claude Code version

Anthropic only accepts OAuth (subscription) requests that look like they came from Claude Code, so the plugin reports a version in the `claude-cli/<version>` User-Agent and in the `cc_version=` billing fingerprint. **That version is a gate, not decoration:** requesting a model newer than the version you claim is rejected outright.

```json
{"type":"error","error":{"type":"invalid_request_error",
 "message":"Claude Code 2.1.87 does not support this model; version 2.1.251 or newer is required.",
 "details":{"error_code":"claude_code_version_too_old"}}}
```

A hard-coded version therefore breaks on *every* model launch, so the plugin resolves it, best-first:

1. **`OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_ANTHROPIC_CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION`** — an explicit pin. Skips the lookup entirely.
2. **npm** — the `latest` dist-tag of [`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code), cached in the data dir for 24 h.
3. **A built-in floor** — a version verified to work, used offline and on a cold first run.

The resolved version only ever moves **up**, so a registry blip or a rolled-back `latest` can never drag the plugin below a version already known to work; use the env pin to go down deliberately. The lookup is a single ~56-byte request fired at startup: the loader awaits only the local cache read, never the network, so neither opencode's startup nor your first request waits on npm — and a registry outage just leaves the previous version in place.

> Only the version *string* is discovered. The request fingerprint's salt is still compiled in, so if Anthropic ever changes that algorithm, pin a known-good version with the env var and open an issue.

## Development

### Scripts

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `bun run build` | Bundle `src/index.ts` → `dist/index.js` + emit `.d.ts`. |
| `bun run dev` | Rebuild the bundle on every change (watch). |
| `bun run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`. |
| `bun run lint` | Lint with oxlint (DevFive shared config). |
| `bun run lint:fix` | Auto-fix lint + formatting. |
| `bun test` | Run the suite **with 100% coverage enforced**. |
| `bun run test:watch` | Re-run tests on change. |
| `bun run status` | Print the dashboard for the current pool. |

### Linting & formatting

[oxlint](https://oxc.rs) with the DevFive shared config — `oxlint.config.ts` re-exports `eslint-plugin-devup/oxlint-config` (single quotes, no semicolons, sorted imports, `interface` over `type`). A husky `pre-commit` hook runs `bun lint`.

```bash
bun run lint        # check
bun run lint:fix    # auto-fix
```

### Testing

```bash
bun test
```

The unit/integration suite runs with coverage **gated at 100%** (lines and functions) via `bunfig.toml`. They mock the network and isolate the pool file per test, so **no real accounts are needed** to test the logic. Tests live in `src/__tests__/`.

### Dev loop (trying it in a real opencode)

opencode loads plugins once at startup, so the loop is:

1. `bun run dev` — keeps `dist/index.js` rebuilt on every edit.
2. Symlink `dist/index.js` into your opencode project's `.opencode/plugins/` once (see install above).
3. Edit code → the watcher rebuilds → **restart opencode** to reload the plugin.
4. Use it; watch the toasts, run `bun run status`, and set `OPENCODE_AUTH_LB_DEBUG=1` to log selections.

### Project structure

```
src/
  index.ts              # plugin entry: 3 exports (Anthropic, OpenAI, Status-tool)

```

## How it works

opencode lets an auth plugin's `loader` return a custom `fetch` that **every** request for a provider flows through. That single choke point ([`src/fetch.ts`](src/fetch.ts)) is where the magic happens, per request:

1. capture opencode's session and user-message ids, then derive the session-affinity key;
2. pick the session's pinned account — or, if it's unavailable / over the soft threshold, the highest **weekly-urgency** account ([`src/scheduler/select.ts`](src/scheduler/select.ts));
3. refresh the OAuth token if needed (singleflight, rotated token persisted);
4. apply provider-specific auth + request transforms (Claude Code identity / Codex Responses quirks);
5. send the request, then record usage from the response headers;
6. on a model-tier `429`, steer across accounts and descend the configured model-family fallback ladder before considering provider pending;
7. on an account-wide `429`/`402`, cool that account and rotate through the remaining accounts;
8. only when every usable account is provider-quota blocked, persist the turn reference before waiting — known exhaustion sends no speculative provider request;
9. on recovery, retry selection; on `Esc`, delete the reference; on restart, reconcile OpenCode's persisted message/history and resume the same message id without duplicating its prompt parts.

The account pool and durable pending references are separate JSON files (opencode's native auth store holds only one credential per provider). Writes are atomic and serialized both in-process and across processes. No daemon runs while opencode is closed; restoration begins only when opencode starts again.

---

## Limitations

- **Bottom status bar** ([`tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.ts`](tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.ts) + [`.view.tsx`](tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.view.tsx) + [`.logic.ts`](tui/auth-load-balancer-tui.logic.ts) + [`auth-load-balancer-scoring.ts`](tui/auth-load-balancer-scoring.ts)) is a SolidJS TUI artifact compiled by opencode (its JSX deps — `solid-js` + `@opentui/*` — are installed as devDependencies, so the `.tsx` view **is** typechecked via `tsconfig.tui.json` and linted, though not render-tested here since that needs a live opencode TUI; its scorer is a byte-identical copy of the unit-tested [`src/scheduler/score-core.ts`](src/scheduler/score-core.ts), enforced by a sync test). It is written against opencode `>=1.18.26` internals (the `app_bottom` slot + the `subagent-footer` usage computation, verified against source); confirm it renders in your opencode build. The toast/tool/CLI cover the account info regardless.
- **OpenAI/Codex** assumes the Responses API; chat-completions → responses conversion is out of scope.
- **Plugin reloads require restart**: opencode loads server plugins once at process startup. After installing a new build, restart the running opencode process once; durable turns are restored on that next start and are never sent while opencode is closed.
- **Cross-process refresh**: per-process singleflight protects token rotation within one opencode instance. Running two opencode instances at once could still race the single-use refresh token.
- **TUI pool writes**: the TUI sidebar's Rename / Delete actions write the pool file atomically (temp + rename) but WITHOUT the cross-process file lock the server uses around its own read-modify-write — so a server usage / cooldown / session / `tokenGen` update committed between the TUI's `readFileSync` and `renameSync` can be silently overwritten. Impact is bounded: the next request re-records usage from response headers, so the window is one cycle of staleness on the affected account; correctness recovers on its own.
- Live OAuth/login and real-account end-to-end behavior should be smoke-tested in your environment; the test suite mocks the network.
