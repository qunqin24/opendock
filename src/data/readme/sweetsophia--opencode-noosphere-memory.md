# Noosphere

Noosphere is a self-hosted knowledge and memory layer for AI agents and humans.  
Agents use it to recall, save, and organize durable and detailed project knowledge; humans use
the same data as a browsable Markdown wiki with topics, revisions, scoped access,
and Obsidian-friendly export/import.  

**All agent systems and humans access the same memory data. You can start in Openclaw and continue in OpenCode and add new data yourself via web browser.** 
The system is database PostgreSQL based with Redis for fast recall. Markdown import and export is possible by the user and agents.
 

It sits between a chat transcript and a full documentation site:

- **Agent memory**: recall relevant project context, save draft memory
  candidates, and promote useful facts into curated articles.
- **Human wiki**: browse, edit, review, restore, and search Markdown articles.
- **Scoped access**: give agents or users narrow API keys for only the knowledge
  they should read or write.
- **Integration-first design**: OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, Opencode, Kilo Code, and
  any REST client can use the same Noosphere instance.

The old long-form README is preserved at [README-legacy.md](README-legacy.md).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install Docker with Docker Compose v2, Node.js 22 or newer, and `curl`. The
installer checks the remaining command-line prerequisites before changing the
machine.

### Install

This launcher is coupled to the coordinated `v1.13.1` image, packages, and
Hermes archive. Before running it, confirm that the
[`v1.13.1` release](https://github.com/SweetSophia/noosphere/releases/tag/v1.13.1)
exists with all six installer assets; a merged commit alone is not a release.

Run the guided installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SweetSophia/noosphere/ef616729339db2114e53f7b199700379fc3435bb/install.sh | bash
```

The URL is pinned to an immutable Git commit—never `master` or `main`. The
launcher then checksum-verifies its exact backend before execution.

The installer:

- shows its plan and detects fresh-install, interrupted-run, or upgrade state;
- offers OpenClaw, Hermes Agent, OpenCode, and Kilo Code integrations found on
  the machine;
- generates distinct runtime credentials without printing them;
- preserves the named PostgreSQL volume and uses the guarded stateful upgrade
  path when an existing installation is present;
- starts the services and verifies Noosphere health.

When it finishes, open `http://127.0.0.1:6578/wiki`. The actual URL is shown if
you selected another bind address.

Generated administrator credentials are stored at
`~/.noosphere/credentials.json` in a mode-`0700` directory with mode `0600`.
The normal output reports the path, not the password or API key.

For an independently verified download, automation flags, existing-installation
warnings, manual Compose deployment, and bootstrap-secret path rules, read
[Installing Noosphere](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

### Existing or customized installations

Do not replace the guided upgrade with an unrestricted `docker compose pull &&
docker compose up`. First inspect the plan without changing the machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SweetSophia/noosphere/ef616729339db2114e53f7b199700379fc3435bb/install.sh \
  | bash -s -- --dry-run --core-only
```

Preserve your configuration, database backup, and local repair records before
upgrading. The installer keeps the `noosphere_postgres_data` volume and admits
an image transition only through its offline, restore-tested controller. See
[PostgreSQL pgvector Compose upgrade](docs/POSTGRES-PGVECTOR-COMPOSE-UPGRADE.md)
for the full stateful recovery contract.

Optional pgvector hybrid storage remains a separate activation step. See
[docker/hybrid-storage/README.md](docker/hybrid-storage/README.md).

## Choose an Integration

| System | What it gets | Start here |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenClaw | Explicit tools, optional prompt-time auto-recall, memory corpus supplement, CLI helpers | [openclaw-noosphere-memory/README.md](openclaw-noosphere-memory/README.md) |
| Hermes Agent | First-class Hermes `MemoryProvider`, recall/get/topics/save tools, optional memory mirroring | [hermes-noosphere-memory/README.md](hermes-noosphere-memory/README.md) |
| Opencode | Prompt-time auto-recall, optional idle auto-save, manual memory tools | [opencode-noosphere-memory/README.md](opencode-noosphere-memory/README.md) |
| Kilo Code | Prompt-time auto-recall, optional idle auto-save, manual memory tools | [kilocode-noosphere-memory/README.md](kilocode-noosphere-memory/README.md) |
| REST clients | Article CRUD, ingest, memory recall/get/save, export/import, graph, health | [API Snapshot](#api-snapshot) |

Use integration-specific environment variables when multiple tools run on one
machine, for example `OPENCLAW_NOOSPHERE_API_KEY`,
`HERMES_NOOSPHERE_API_KEY`, `OPENCODE_NOOSPHERE_API_KEY`, or
`KILOCODE_NOOSPHERE_API_KEY`. The generic `NOOSPHERE_API_KEY` fallback remains
available for simple single-tool setups.

## Core Concepts

### Topics and Articles

Topics form an unlimited-depth hierarchy. Articles live inside topics, render as
GitHub-flavored Markdown, and can include tags, source metadata, images,
confidence, status, revision history, and related-article edges.

### Memory Recall

The memory layer normalizes results from providers, ranks them, deduplicates
overlap, handles conflicts, and budgets the returned context for prompt use.
Current providers include Noosphere articles and Hindsight; the provider
contract is extensible.

See [docs/NOOSPHERE-MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/NOOSPHERE-MEMORY-ARCHITECTURE.md)
for the implementation model.

### Draft Saves and Curation

Agent saves are draft memory candidates by default. That keeps automatic memory
capture inspectable before it becomes curated wiki knowledge.

### Scopes

Restricted articles use `restrictedTags`; scoped API keys and scoped users can
only read or write content allowed by their scopes. A wildcard `*` scope grants
full restricted-content access and should be reserved for admin workflows.

### Obsidian and Markdown

Noosphere can export/import Markdown vault archives and supports an Obsidian
sync workflow through a versioned frontmatter codec. The sync design lives in
[docs/OBSIDIAN-SYNC-SPEC.md](docs/OBSIDIAN-SYNC-SPEC.md).

## API Snapshot

Base URL:

```text
http://localhost:6578/api
```

Authentication (replace `<api_key>` with a scoped Noosphere API key):

```text
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
```

Common endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Service health check |
| `GET` | `/api/topics` | List the complete topic tree (maximum 500 topics; returns `409` above the limit) |
| `GET` | `/api/articles` | Search/list articles |
| `POST` | `/api/articles` | Create an article |
| `PATCH` | `/api/articles/:id` | Update an article |
| `POST` | `/api/ingest` | Ingest external material into articles |
| `POST` | `/api/answer` | Save a synthesized answer as an article |
| `GET` | `/api/graph` | Read the wiki graph |
| `GET` | `/api/export` | Export a Markdown vault ZIP |
| `POST` | `/api/import` | Import a Markdown vault ZIP |
| `GET` | `/api/memory/status` | Memory provider/settings overview |
| `POST` | `/api/memory/recall` | Recall ranked memory results |
| `POST` | `/api/memory/get` | Fetch one memory by canonical ref or ID |
| `POST` | `/api/memory/save` | Save a draft memory candidate |
| `POST` | `/api/memory/captures` | Accept one private automatic-memory observation when explicitly enabled |
| `GET` | `/api/memory/captures` | Admin capture inspection (raw text is detail-only) |
| `GET` | `/api/memory/captures/:id` | Read eligible capture status/raw detail as its bound creator, or inspect quarantined evidence as a scope-authorized administrator |
| `GET/POST` | `/api/memory/principals` | Admin principal inspection/provisioning |
| `POST` | `/api/memory/revocations` | Admin session-lineage revocation |
| `GET` | `/api/memory/{candidates,jobs,tombstones,privacy-reviews}` | Admin Phase A lifecycle inspection |

JSON write endpoints reject malformed or excessively nested payloads and return
`413` when their route-specific body-size limit is exceeded. Most routes allow
64 KiB; article writes allow approximately 1 MiB, and batch ingest allows 4 MiB.
`POST /api/memory/recall` allows 120 requests per minute per client IP by
default so several local coding CLIs can use prompt-time recall concurrently.
Set `NOOSPHERE_MEMORY_RECALL_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` to tune that read-only
endpoint for your deployment.

Example recall request:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:6578/api/memory/recall \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ***" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"deployment runbook","mode":"auto","resultCap":5}'
```

## Local Development

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 22+
- Docker and Docker Compose

Setup:

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit the bootstrap, migration, and application database credentials plus
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXTAUTH_URL, and APP_URL.
docker network create noosphere-net 2>/dev/null || true
mkdir -p .noosphere/postgres-pgvector-backups
chmod 700 .noosphere/postgres-pgvector-backups
guard=(./scripts/switch-pgvector-compose.sh --compose-file "$PWD/docker-compose.yml" \
  --env-file "$PWD/.env" --db-container noosphere-db --app-container noosphere-app \
  --backup-dir "$PWD/.noosphere/postgres-pgvector-backups")
"${guard[@]}" --prepare-new-install
docker compose up -d db redis
docker compose run --rm -T init
"${guard[@]}" --record-new-install
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
DATABASE_URL="$NOOSPHERE_APP_DATABASE_URL" PORT=6578 npm run dev
```

The external `noosphere_postgres_authorization` volume is created only by the
guard, so an ordinary candidate Compose start fails closed. When the
development Compose project reuses an existing
`noosphere_postgres_data` volume created by the former source image, run the
guarded PostgreSQL image transition before the first `docker compose up` from
this revision.

Useful checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

Package-specific plugin checks live in each plugin README.

## Operations

Health and deployment checks:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:6578/api/health
NOOSPHERE_POSTGRES_EVIDENCE=/absolute/private/path/postgres-pgvector/noosphere_postgres_data.phase-a2b.json \
  npm run deploy:verify
docker compose logs -f app
```

Production deploys should preserve the pinned Compose project and named volumes:

- Compose project: `noosphere`
- PostgreSQL volume: `noosphere_postgres_data`
- Redis volume: `noosphere_redis_data`

Candidate verification requires the active completed Phase A2b journal through
`NOOSPHERE_POSTGRES_EVIDENCE`. `npm run deploy:verify` fails if that evidence
does not bind the running database image, data volume, authorization volume, and
template probe; if PostgreSQL exposes the wrong pgvector capability or has
activated `vector` in any database/template; or if there are no topics,
articles, or API keys. The guarded Phase A2b transition and recovery contract is
documented in
[docs/POSTGRES-PGVECTOR-COMPOSE-UPGRADE.md](docs/POSTGRES-PGVECTOR-COMPOSE-UPGRADE.md).

Keep detailed recovery work in deployment/runbook docs rather than this README.
