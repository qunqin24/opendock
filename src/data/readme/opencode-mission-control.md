## The Problem

AI coding is fast, but context switching is slow. Running multiple agents in a single directory leads to file conflicts, messy git history, and "who-changed-what" headaches. You end up waiting for one agent to finish before starting the next, wasting the most valuable resource you have: **your time** (and, occasionally, your patience).

## The Solution

Mission Control orchestrates **isolated environments** for your AI agents. Each job gets its own git worktree and tmux session — complete filesystem isolation. You can monitor progress, capture output, or attach to any session at any time. When the work is done, sync changes back or create a PR with a single command.

For complex multi-task workflows, the **Plan System** handles dependency graphs, merge ordering, automated testing, and PR creation — all orchestrated automatically. Less herding cats, more shipping code.

## How It Works

```

1. **Launch** — `mc_launch` creates a git worktree + tmux session and starts an AI agent inside it
2. **Monitor** — The background monitor polls every 10s, tracking output, idle state, and pane death
3. **Observe** — Use `mc_status`, `mc_capture`, or `mc_attach` to check on progress
4. **Integrate** — Use `mc_diff` to review, `mc_pr` to create a PR, `mc_merge` to merge, or `mc_sync` to rebase

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Required | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| **[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)** | Yes | Session isolation and monitoring |
| **[git](https://git-scm.com/)** | Yes | Worktree management |
| **[gh](https://cli.github.com/)** | For `mc_pr` | GitHub PR creation |

### Installation (OpenCode Plugin)

Most OpenCode setups install plugins listed in `opencode.json` automatically, so you usually **do not** run `npm install` manually.

Add this plugin entry:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "opencode-mission-control"
  ]
}
```

If you are developing this repository itself, use the local dev flow in [Development](#development).

### Your First Job

```
You: "Fix the login bug and add the pricing table — do both at once."

AI: Launching two parallel jobs now.
    → mc_launch(name: "fix-login", prompt: "Fix the authentication bug in...")
    → mc_launch(name: "add-pricing", prompt: "Create a pricing table component...")

You: "How's the login fix going?"

AI: → mc_capture(name: "fix-login")
    Still running. Here's the latest output from that session...

You: "Login fix looks good. Create a PR."

AI: → mc_pr(name: "fix-login", title: "Fix: auth token validation")
    PR created: https://github.com/you/repo/pull/42
```

### More Usage Examples

#### 1) Run two tasks in parallel, then compare output

```
You: "Run a docs cleanup and a bugfix in parallel."

AI: → mc_launch(name: "docs-cleanup", prompt: "Clean up README wording")
    → mc_launch(name: "fix-auth-timeout", prompt: "Fix token timeout bug")

You: "Show me what changed in the bugfix branch."

AI: → mc_diff(name: "fix-auth-timeout")
```

#### 2) Monitor everything in one command

```
You: "What's happening right now?"

AI: → mc_overview()
```

#### 3) Stop a runaway job and clean up

```
You: "Kill the experiment and remove its worktree."

AI: → mc_kill(name: "wild-experiment")
    → mc_cleanup(name: "wild-experiment", deleteBranch: true)
```

#### 4) Keep a long job current with main

```
You: "Rebase the feature job onto latest main."

AI: → mc_sync(name: "feature-checkout", strategy: "rebase")
```

#### 5) Orchestrate dependent work automatically

```
AI: → mc_plan(
      name: "feat: search upgrade",
      mode: "autopilot",
      jobs: [
        { name: "schema", prompt: "Add search index tables" },
        { name: "api", prompt: "Implement search endpoints", dependsOn: ["schema"] },
        { name: "ui", prompt: "Build search UI", dependsOn: ["api"] }
      ]
    )
```

Because waiting is overrated.

#### 6) Target a non-default branch

```
You: "Fix these bugs on the develop branch, not main."

AI: → mc_launch(name: "fix-auth", prompt: "Fix the JWT bug", baseBranch: "develop")
    → mc_launch(name: "fix-timeout", prompt: "Fix the timeout issue", baseBranch: "develop")

You: "Auth fix looks good. Create a PR targeting develop."

AI: → mc_pr(name: "fix-auth", title: "fix: JWT token validation")
    PR created targeting 'develop': https://github.com/you/repo/pull/43
```

#### 7) Orchestrate a plan on a feature branch

```
AI: → mc_plan(
      name: "feat: search upgrade",
      baseBranch: "develop",
      mode: "autopilot",
      jobs: [
        { name: "schema", prompt: "Add search tables" },
        { name: "api", prompt: "Build search API", dependsOn: ["schema"] }
      ]
    )

Result:
  • Integration branch created from 'develop'
  • schema launches from 'develop', api launches from integration HEAD
  • PR targets 'develop' when all jobs merge
```

#### 8) Sync a job with its base branch

```
You: "The develop branch has new changes. Update my job."

AI: → mc_sync(name: "fix-auth", source: "origin")
    Successfully synced job "fix-auth" using rebase strategy.
```

By default, `mc_sync` syncs against the local base branch. Use `source: "origin"` to fetch the latest from the remote first.

## Choosing Between Launch and Plan

The two main entry points — `mc_launch` and `mc_plan` — serve different workflows. Picking the right one saves you time and merge headaches.

### Use `mc_launch` when...

| Scenario | Why Launch |
|----------|-----------|
| **Independent tasks on different files** | No dependency management needed. Launch both, merge in any order. |
| **Quick experiments or spikes** | Spin up a job, review the diff, keep it or kill it. Zero ceremony. |
| **You want full manual control** | You decide what merges, when, and in what order. |
| **More than 3 concurrent jobs** | Plans respect `maxParallel` (default 3). Standalone launches have no limit. |

**Typical launch workflow:**
```
mc_launch("fix-auth", "Fix the JWT expiry bug in src/auth/")
mc_launch("add-pricing", "Build pricing table in src/components/pricing/")
  ↓ both complete
mc_diff("fix-auth")       → review
mc_merge("fix-auth")      → into main
mc_diff("add-pricing")    → review
mc_merge("add-pricing")   → into main
```

### Use `mc_plan` when...

| Scenario | Why Plan |
|----------|---------|
| **Work has a dependency chain** | Job B needs job A to finish first. `dependsOn` handles ordering and code propagation automatically. |
| **You want automated test gating** | The merge train runs your test suite after each merge and rolls back on failure. You don't get this with standalone launches. |
| **You want a single PR for a feature** | Plan creates one integration branch and opens a single PR when everything merges. |
| **You want hands-off execution** | Autopilot mode: launch, merge, test, PR — all automatic. Walk away. |

**Typical plan workflow:**
```
mc_plan("feat: search upgrade", mode: "autopilot", jobs: [
  { name: "schema", prompt: "Add search tables..." },
  { name: "api", prompt: "Build search endpoints...", dependsOn: ["schema"] },
  { name: "ui", prompt: "Build search UI...", dependsOn: ["api"] }
])
  ↓ automatic
schema launches → completes → merges into integration branch
api launches (sees schema's changes) → completes → merges → tests run
ui launches (sees schema + api changes) → completes → merges → tests run
  ↓
PR created automatically
```

### Quick Decision Guide

```
Do the jobs touch completely different files?
  YES → mc_launch both in parallel, merge independently.

Does job B need code that job A creates?
  YES → mc_plan with dependsOn. B launches from the integration
        branch and sees A's changes.

Do you want tests to run after each merge?
  YES → mc_plan (merge train runs testCommand automatically).

Do you want one PR for all the work?
  YES → mc_plan.

None of the above?
  → mc_launch. Simpler, more flexible, less overhead.
```

### Working With Shared Files

The trickiest scenario is when multiple jobs need to edit the **same files** — for example, two features on the same React view. Even if the work is conceptually separate ("left panel" vs "right panel"), git sees two branches editing the same lines of the same file.

**The scaffold pattern** solves this by creating file boundaries first:

```
Step 1: Launch a quick scaffolding job
  mc_launch("scaffold", "Split Dashboard.tsx into separate
    LeftPanel and RightPanel component files. Keep them as
    stubs with TODO comments. Update Dashboard.tsx to import
    and render both.")

Step 2: Merge the scaffold
  mc_merge("scaffold")

Step 3: Launch the real work in parallel — now they touch different files
  mc_launch("left-panel", "Implement LeftPanel in src/components/LeftPanel.tsx...")
  mc_launch("right-panel", "Implement RightPanel in src/components/RightPanel.tsx...")

Step 4: Merge both — no conflicts
  mc_merge("left-panel")
  mc_merge("right-panel")
```

The scaffold job takes a couple of minutes and eliminates the merge conflict surface entirely.

**If you can't separate the files** (heavy shared state, tightly coupled components), don't force parallelism. Use a plan with `dependsOn` so the second job builds on top of the first, or just run them sequentially with standalone launches.

| Overlap Level | Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| **No shared files** | Parallel `mc_launch` |
| **1-2 shared files** (parent component, types) | Scaffold first, then parallel |
| **Many shared files** (shared state, hooks, styles) | Sequential — `mc_plan` with `dependsOn` or manual launches |

## Tools Reference

### Job Lifecycle

#### `mc_launch`

Launch a new parallel AI coding session in an isolated worktree.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | — | Job name (used for branch name and tmux target) |
| `prompt` | `string` | Yes | — | Task prompt for the spawned AI agent |
| `branch` | `string` | No | `mc/{name}` | Git branch name |
| `baseBranch` | `string` | No | Default branch | Branch or ref to start from (e.g. `"develop"`) |
| `placement` | `"session"` \| `"window"` | No | Config default | `session` creates a new tmux session; `window` adds a window to the current session |
| `mode` | `"vanilla"` \| `"plan"` \| `"ralph"` \| `"ulw"` | No | Config default | Execution mode (see [OMO Integration](#omo-integration)) |
| `planFile` | `string` | No | — | Plan file path (for `plan` mode) |

| `symlinkDirs` | `string[]` | No | — | Directories to symlink (e.g. `["node_modules"]`). `.opencode` is always included. |
| `commands` | `string[]` | No | — | Shell commands to run after worktree creation (e.g. `["bun install"]`). Validated against injection patterns — use `allowUnsafeCommands` in config to bypass. |

**What happens on launch:**
1. Creates a new git worktree on a dedicated branch
2. Runs post-create hooks (copy files, create symlinks, run commands)
3. Spins up a tmux session or window
4. Starts `opencode --prompt '...'` inside the tmux pane
5. Sets up pane-died hook for completion detection
6. Registers the job for background monitoring

#### `mc_jobs`

List all jobs with their current status.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `status` | `"all"` \| `"running"` \| `"completed"` \| `"failed"` | No | `"all"` | Filter by status |

#### `mc_status`

Get detailed status of a specific job including branch, worktree path, tmux target, duration, and mode.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | Job name |

#### `mc_capture`

Capture the last N lines of terminal output from a job's tmux pane.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | — | Job name |
| `lines` | `number` | No | `100` | Number of lines to capture |

#### `mc_attach`

#### `mc_cleanup`

Remove finished job worktrees and metadata.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | No | — | Specific job to clean up |
| `all` | `boolean` | No | `false` | Clean up all non-running jobs |
| `deleteBranch` | `boolean` | No | `false` | Also delete the git branch |

---

### Monitoring & Reporting

#### `mc_overview`

Get a complete dashboard overview of all Mission Control activity — running jobs, recent completions, failures, active plans, alerts, and suggested next actions. This is the best starting point when checking in on your jobs.

*No parameters.*

#### `mc_report`

Report agent status back to Mission Control. Auto-detects which job is calling based on the current worktree. This tool is designed to be called by spawned agents from within their managed worktrees — it cannot be used from the main session.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `status` | `"working"` \| `"blocked"` \| `"needs_review"` \| `"completed"` \| `"progress"` | Yes | — | Current agent status |
| `message` | `string` | Yes | — | Human-readable status message |
| `progress` | `number` | No | — | Completion percentage (0–100) |

Reports are used by the monitoring system to:
- Trigger notifications (e.g., when an agent reports `blocked` or `needs_review`)
- Signal explicit completion (a `completed` report immediately marks the job as done)
- Provide progress visibility via `mc_status` and `mc_overview`

---

### Git Workflow

#### `mc_diff`

Compare a job's branch against the base branch.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | — | Job name |
| `stat` | `boolean` | No | `false` | Show diffstat summary only |
| `baseBranch` | `string` | No | Job's base branch | Override base branch for diff comparison |

#### `mc_pr`

Push the job's branch and create a GitHub Pull Request. Requires the `gh` CLI to be authenticated.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | — | Job name |
| `title` | `string` | No | Job name | PR title — use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (e.g. `feat: add login`, `fix: resolve timeout`) |
| `body` | `string` | No | PR template or auto-generated | PR body. If omitted, uses `.github/pull_request_template.md` if found, otherwise generates a summary. |
| `baseBranch` | `string` | No | Job's base branch or default | Target branch for the PR (falls back to job's `baseBranch`, then default branch) |
| `draft` | `boolean` | No | `false` | Create as draft PR |

#### `mc_sync`

Pull the latest changes from the base branch into a job's worktree.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | — | Job name |
| `strategy` | `"rebase"` \| `"merge"` | No | `"rebase"` | Sync strategy. Aborts on conflict and reports affected files. |
| `source` | `"local"` \| `"origin"` | No | `"local"` | Sync against the local base branch (default) or fetch from origin first |

#### `mc_merge`

Merge a job's branch back into the main worktree.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | — | Job name |
| `strategy` | `"squash"` \| `"ff-only"` \| `"merge"` | No | Config `mergeStrategy` (default `"squash"`) | Merge strategy. `squash` squashes all commits; `ff-only` rebases then fast-forwards; `merge` creates a merge commit (`--no-ff`). |
| `squash` | `boolean` | No | `false` | **Deprecated** — use `strategy` instead. If set and no `strategy` is provided, `squash: true` maps to `strategy: "squash"`. |
| `message` | `string` | No | Auto-generated | Merge commit message |

---

## Orchestrated Plans

For workflows with dependencies between jobs, the **Plan System** manages the full lifecycle — from parallel execution to merge ordering to PR creation.

### `mc_plan`

Create and start a multi-job orchestrated plan.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | — | Plan name — used as the PR title, so use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (e.g. `feat: add search`, `fix: resolve auth bugs`) |
| `jobs` | `JobSpec[]` | Yes | — | Array of job definitions (see below) |
| `mode` | `"autopilot"` \| `"copilot"` \| `"supervisor"` | No | `"autopilot"` | Execution mode |
| `placement` | `"session"` \| `"window"` | No | Config default | tmux placement for all jobs in this plan |
| `baseBranch` | `string` | No | Default branch | Base branch for the integration branch and PR target |

**JobSpec fields:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | Unique job name |
| `prompt` | `string` | Yes | Task prompt for the AI agent |
| `dependsOn` | `string[]` | No | Job names this job depends on (must complete and merge first) |
| `touchSet` | `string[]` | No | File globs this job expects to modify. After completion, the orchestrator validates that only files matching these patterns were changed. Violations pause the plan — see [TouchSet Enforcement](#touchset-enforcement). |
| `mode` | `"vanilla"` \| `"plan"` \| `"ralph"` \| `"ulw"` | No | Execution mode override (defaults to `omo.defaultMode` config) |
| `copyFiles` | `string[]` | No | Files to copy into the worktree |
| `symlinkDirs` | `string[]` | No | Directories to symlink into the worktree |
| `commands` | `string[]` | No | Post-creation shell commands |

### Plan Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Autopilot** | Full hands-off execution. Jobs launch, merge, and a PR is created automatically. |
| **Copilot** | Plan is created in `pending` state. You review it with `mc_plan_status`, then approve with `mc_plan_approve` to start. |
| **Supervisor** | Execution pauses at **checkpoints** (`pre_merge`, `on_error`, `pre_pr`) requiring manual `mc_plan_approve` to continue. |

### Plan Lifecycle

```
mc_plan
  │
  ├─ Validate (unique names, valid deps, no circular deps)
   ├─ Create integration branch: mc/integration-{plan-id}
  │
  ├─ [copilot] ──→ Pause (pending) ──→ mc_plan_approve ──→ Continue
  │
  ├─ Topological sort jobs by dependencies
  ├─ Launch jobs (respects maxParallel limit)
  │   • Root jobs branch from baseCommit
  │   • Dependent jobs branch from integration HEAD (sees merged code)
  │   • Branches use plan-scoped naming: mc/plan/{planId}/{jobName}
  │
  │   ┌──────── Reconciler Loop (5s) ────────┐
  │   │                                       │
  │   │  • Check dependency satisfaction      │
  │   │  • Launch ready jobs                  │
  │   │  • Process merge train                │
  │   │  • [supervisor] Pause at checkpoints  │
  │   │                                       │
  │   └───────────────────────────────────────┘
  │
  ├─ Merge Train: merge each job into integration branch
  │   ├─ Merge (--no-ff)
  │   ├─ Run test command (if configured)
  │   ├─ On failure → rollback merge, mark failed
  │   └─ On conflict → abort, mark conflict
  │
  ├─ All jobs merged → push integration branch
  └─ Create PR via gh CLI
```

### Plan Control Tools

#### `mc_plan_status`

Show the current state of the active plan — job statuses, progress, and any checkpoints.

*No parameters.*

#### `mc_plan_approve`

Approve a pending copilot plan, clear a supervisor checkpoint, or handle a failed job. When a touchSet violation pauses the plan, three actions are available:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `checkpoint` | `"pre_merge"` \| `"on_error"` \| `"pre_pr"` | No | Specific checkpoint to clear (supervisor mode) |
| `retry` | `string` | No | Name of a failed/conflict/needs_rebase job to retry after manual fix. Re-validates touchSet before proceeding. |
| `relaunch` | `string` | No | Name of a touchSet-failed job to relaunch. Spawns a new agent in the existing worktree with a correction prompt. |

**TouchSet violation options:**

| Action | Command | Behavior |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Accept** | `mc_plan_approve(checkpoint: "on_error")` | Violations are legitimate — skip validation and proceed to merge |
| **Relaunch** | `mc_plan_approve(checkpoint: "on_error", relaunch: "job")` | Spawn agent to fix — relaunches in existing worktree with violation details |
| **Retry** | `mc_plan_approve(checkpoint: "on_error", retry: "job")` | You fixed it manually — re-validates touchSet, then proceeds if clean |

#### `mc_plan_cancel`

Cancel the active plan. Stops all running jobs, deletes the integration branch, and cleans up state.

*No parameters.*

### Example: Orchestrated Plan

This example uses `mc_plan` instead of four separate `mc_launch` calls because:
- **The API needs the DB schema to exist** — `api-endpoints` imports from the schema tables that `db-schema` creates. With `dependsOn`, the API job launches from the integration branch and can see those tables.
- **The UI needs the API types** — `dashboard-ui` imports the response types that `api-endpoints` defines.
- **Docs and UI are independent of each other** — they both depend on `api-endpoints` but don't share files, so the plan runs them in parallel.
- **One PR for the whole feature** — instead of four separate PRs, the merge train produces a single integration branch.

```
AI: I'll create a plan for the dashboard feature with proper dependencies.

    jobs: [
      {
        name: "db-schema",
        prompt: "Add the analytics tables to the database schema"
      },
      {
        name: "api-endpoints",
        prompt: "Create REST endpoints for the analytics dashboard",
        dependsOn: ["db-schema"]
      },
      {
        name: "dashboard-ui",
        prompt: "Build the analytics dashboard React components",
        dependsOn: ["api-endpoints"]
      },
      {
        name: "docs",
        prompt: "Update API documentation for analytics endpoints",
        dependsOn: ["api-endpoints"]
      }
    ]
  )

Result:
  • db-schema launches immediately
  • api-endpoints waits for db-schema to merge — then launches with schema changes visible
  • dashboard-ui and docs wait for api-endpoints — then run in parallel
  • The merge train tests after each merge and rolls back on failure
  • Once all merge successfully, a single PR is created automatically
```

> **Why not `mc_launch`?** You *could* launch these sequentially, merging each into main before starting the next. But you'd lose the automated test gating, the single integration PR, and the parallel execution of `dashboard-ui` and `docs`. The plan handles the dependency graph, merge ordering, and PR creation — you just check `mc_plan_status` or wait for the completion notification.

### TouchSet Enforcement

When a job specifies `touchSet` patterns, the orchestrator validates the job's changes after completion — before the job enters the merge train. If the job modified files that don't match any `touchSet` glob, the plan pauses with an `on_error` checkpoint:

```
❌ Job "db-schema" modified files outside its touchSet:
  Violations: src/types/search.ts, src/utils/format.ts
  Allowed: src/db/**

Options:
  Accept violations:  mc_plan_approve(checkpoint: "on_error")
  Agent fixes branch: mc_plan_approve(checkpoint: "on_error", relaunch: "db-schema")
  You fix, re-check:  mc_plan_approve(checkpoint: "on_error", retry: "db-schema")
```

| Option | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| **Accept** | You reviewed the violations and they're legitimate (e.g., the agent needed to update shared types) |
| **Relaunch** | The violations are accidental — a new agent spawns in the same worktree with a correction prompt to revert them |
| **Retry** | You manually fixed the branch — Mission Control re-validates the touchSet before proceeding |

The **relaunch** path reuses the existing worktree and branch. The correction agent sees the full git history and receives a prompt with the original task, the specific violations, and the allowed patterns. After the agent completes, touchSet validation runs again automatically.

### Merge Train

The Merge Train is the engine behind plan integration. Each completed job's branch is merged into a dedicated **integration branch** (`mc/integration-{plan-id}`):

1. **TouchSet validation** — If `touchSet` is configured, verify the job only modified allowed files (violations pause the plan)
2. **Merge** — `git merge --no-ff {job-branch}` into the integration worktree
3. **Test** — If a `testCommand` is configured (or detected from `package.json`), it runs after each merge
4. **Rollback** — If tests fail or time out, the merge is automatically rolled back (`git merge --abort` or `git reset --hard HEAD~1`)
5. **Conflict detection** — Merge conflicts are caught, reported with file-level detail, and the merge is aborted

Once all jobs are merged and tests pass, the integration branch is pushed and a PR is created.

## Slash Commands

These commands run directly in the OpenCode chat — instant execution without an AI roundtrip (except `/mc-launch`, which delegates to the AI).

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/mc` | Show Mission Control dashboard overview (runs `mc_overview`) |
| `/mc-jobs` | List all jobs and their status |
| `/mc-launch <prompt>` | Launch a new parallel agent (delegates to AI) |
| `/mc-status <name>` | Detailed status of a specific job |
| `/mc-attach <name>` | Get the tmux attach command |
| `/mc-capture <name>` | Capture terminal output from a job |
| `/mc-diff <name>` | Show changes in a job's branch |
| `/mc-plan` | Show plan status (runs `mc_plan_status`) |
| `/mc-approve` | Approve a pending plan or checkpoint |
| `/mc-cleanup [name]` | Clean up finished jobs (all if no name given) |

---

## Monitoring System

Mission Control runs an active background monitor — not a passive wrapper.

### How Monitoring Works

| Mechanism | Interval | What It Does |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| **Polling** | Every `pollInterval` (default 10s) | Checks if each job's tmux pane is still running |
| **Pane death detection** | Immediate | tmux `pane-died` hook fires when a pane closes, capturing exit status |
| **Idle detection** | `idleThreshold` (default 5min) | Hashes terminal output; if unchanged for the threshold period and the session shows the idle prompt (`ctrl+p commands`), marks the job as completed |
| **Exit code capture** | On pane death | Exit code `0` → completed. Non-zero → failed. |
| **Session state detection** | On idle check | Distinguishes `idle` (waiting for input), `streaming` (AI is working), and `unknown` states |

### Hooks & Lifecycle

| Hook | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| `session.idle` | User's main session goes quiet | Shows toast notification with running job summary (rate-limited to once per 5 minutes) |
| `session.compacting` | OpenCode compacts context | Injects current job state into the AI's memory so it stays aware of background work |
| `pane-died` | tmux pane closes | Immediately captures exit status and updates job state |

### Configuration Reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `defaultPlacement` | `"session"` \| `"window"` | `"session"` | Default tmux placement for new jobs |
| `pollInterval` | `number` | `10000` | Monitoring poll interval in ms (minimum 10s) |
| `idleThreshold` | `number` | `300000` | Time in ms before an idle session is marked completed (default 5min) |
| `worktreeBasePath` | `string` | `~/.local/share/opencode-mission-control` | Root directory for worktrees |

### Worktree Setup

Every job creates a fresh git worktree. The `worktreeSetup` config (and per-job `copyFiles`/`symlinkDirs`/`commands` params) lets you prepare the environment:

- **`copyFiles`** — Copies files from the main worktree (great for `.env`, config files)
- **`symlinkDirs`** — Creates symlinks to avoid re-downloading (great for `node_modules`, `.cache`)
- **`commands`** — Runs shell commands after setup (great for `bun install`, `pip install -e .`). Commands are validated against shell injection patterns (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, backticks, `$()`). Set `allowUnsafeCommands: true` in config to bypass validation for advanced use cases.

Per-job parameters are **merged** with the global `worktreeSetup` config.

## OMO Integration

If you use [Oh-My-OpenCode (OMO)](https://github.com/nicholasgriffintn/oh-my-opencode), Mission Control unlocks advanced execution modes for spawned agents. These are **optional** — everything works without OMO installed.

| Mode | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `vanilla` | Standard `opencode --prompt '...'` execution |
| `plan` | Loads a Sisyphus plan. Copies `.sisyphus/plans` to the worktree and runs `/start-work`. |
| `ralph` | Starts a self-correcting Ralph Loop via `/ralph-loop` |
| `ulw` | Activates high-intensity Ultrawork mode via `/ulw-loop` |

OMO detection is automatic — Mission Control checks your `opencode.json` for the `oh-my-opencode` plugin.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Where are worktrees stored?</strong></summary>

By default in `~/.local/share/opencode-mission-control/{project}/`. They are real git worktrees — fully functional working copies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use this without tmux?</strong></summary>

No. tmux is the backbone of session isolation, monitoring, idle detection, and output capture. It's a hard requirement.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it work with VS Code / Cursor?</strong></summary>

Yes. You can open any job's worktree directory in your editor. The AI agents run in background tmux sessions independently.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if my computer restarts?</strong></summary>

Mission Control will detect dead tmux panes on the next poll and mark those jobs as failed. Use `mc_cleanup` to clean up.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How many jobs can I run at once?</strong></summary>

As many as your machine can handle. Each job is a real OS process with its own file tree. The `maxParallel` setting only applies to orchestrated plans. Individual `mc_launch` calls have no built-in limit.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if two jobs edit the same file?</strong></summary>

Each job has its own worktree, so there are no runtime conflicts — they can't step on each other while running. Conflicts surface at merge time when you bring the branches back together (via `mc_merge` or the plan's merge train).

To avoid this, use the **scaffold pattern**: launch a quick job to split the shared file into separate components first, merge it, then launch the real work in parallel on the now-separate files. See [Working With Shared Files](#working-with-shared-files) for the full strategy.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I attach to a job's terminal while it's running?</strong></summary>

Yes. Use `mc_attach` to get the tmux command, then run it in your terminal. You'll see the live AI session.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does the plan merge train handle test failures?</strong></summary>

If the configured `testCommand` fails after a merge, the merge is automatically rolled back. The job is marked as failed and the plan status updates accordingly (in supervisor mode, it pauses for your review).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens if a job modifies files outside its touchSet?</strong></summary>

The plan pauses at an `on_error` checkpoint with three options: **accept** the violations if they're legitimate, **relaunch** the agent with a correction prompt to fix them, or **retry** after you fix the branch manually. See [TouchSet Enforcement](#touchset-enforcement) for details.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why not just tell my agents to run <code>git worktree add</code> themselves?</strong></summary>

You absolutely can — worktrees are just git. What you'd be rebuilding manually is everything around them:

- tmux session isolation with pane-death detection
- Background monitoring that tracks idle/streaming/completed states
- The merge train that tests after each integration and rolls back failures
- Dependency-aware scheduling with `maxParallel` limits
- The scaffold-and-sync workflow for shared files
- Automatic PR creation from integration branches
- The `mc_overview` dashboard that shows you what every agent is doing at a glance

Mission Control is the orchestration layer on top of worktrees, not the worktrees themselves.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this built by the OpenCode team?</strong></summary>

No. This is an independent community plugin — not affiliated with or endorsed by the OpenCode team.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to manually install this with npm first?</strong></summary>

Usually no. Put it in `opencode.json` and let OpenCode handle plugin installation. Manual npm install is mostly for local development or debugging.
</details>

## Release & npm Deploy

This repo uses semantic versioning with **semantic-release** for automated npm releases.

How it works:

1. Merge a Conventional Commit into `main` (for example: `feat:`, `fix:`, or `BREAKING CHANGE:`).
2. GitHub Actions runs build + tests.
3. `semantic-release` calculates the next version, publishes to npm, creates a GitHub Release, and tags automatically.

Expected repository secrets:

- `NPM_TOKEN` — npm publish token with package publish rights.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` — provided automatically by GitHub Actions.

If your commit messages are vague, semantic-release gets moody.
