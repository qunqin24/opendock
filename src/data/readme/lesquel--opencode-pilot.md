## What it does

Spin up OpenCode locally, get a web dashboard you can open on your laptop or phone. From the dashboard you can:

- See all your sessions across all your projects (multi-project tabs)
- Send prompts and watch responses stream live
- Approve / deny tool permissions remotely
- Switch agents (build / plan / general / explore) per session
- Track cost per session, per day, per week
- Get sound, browser, push, and Telegram notifications when an agent finishes
- Pin TODOs that survive across sessions
- Diff view of all files changed
- File browser with live filter
- Connect from your phone via QR code (LAN or public tunnel)
- **Monitor [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) sessions too** via the `/codex/hooks/:event` HTTP bridge — same dashboard, same notifications, same permission flow (see [`docs/CODEX-INTEGRATION.md`](./docs/CODEX-INTEGRATION.md))

All from one keyboard shortcut (`?` opens the command palette).

---

## Install once, use everywhere

opencode-pilot installs **globally into your OpenCode config dir** (`~/.config/opencode` on Linux/macOS, `%APPDATA%\opencode` on Windows). One install and the plugin auto-loads every time you run `opencode` from **any project directory** — no per-project setup, no `.opencode/` folders to copy around, no duplicate configs.

That's the whole point of running the installer: drop it in once, then just use `opencode` normally and the dashboard is always there.

## Quick Start

### One command (recommended)

```bash
npx @lesquel/opencode-pilot init
# or
bunx @lesquel/opencode-pilot init
```

That's it. The installer:
1. Locates your OpenCode config dir (`~/.config/opencode` or your XDG path / `%APPDATA%`).
2. Installs the plugin there (`@lesquel/opencode-pilot@latest` + `@opencode-ai/plugin@latest`).
3. Adds `"@lesquel/opencode-pilot@latest"` to **both** `opencode.json::plugin` (for the dashboard server) and `tui.json::plugin` (for the slash commands). OpenCode uses two separate plugin loaders — one file each.
4. Cleans up stale wrappers, cache entries, and legacy subpath specs left by earlier (<=1.12.x) installs.

Fully close any running OpenCode sessions and reopen. A toast should appear:

> **OpenCode Pilot** — Remote control plugin loaded. Use `/pilot` or `/pilot-token`.

The banner also prints in the terminal with URL + token + QR. If the toast doesn't appear, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting--slash-commands-dont-appear).

> **Configuration is done from the dashboard** (gear icon → Plugin configuration). You do NOT need to create a `.env` — though you still can if you prefer.

### Manual install (if you want to)

```bash
# 1. Install in your OpenCode config dir
cd ~/.config/opencode    # or your XDG_CONFIG_HOME path
bun add @lesquel/opencode-pilot@latest @opencode-ai/plugin@latest

# 2. Add the spec to BOTH config files:
#
#    opencode.json  — registers the dashboard server plugin:
#    {
#      "plugin": ["@lesquel/opencode-pilot@latest"]
#    }
#
#    tui.json  — registers the slash commands (create this file if missing):
#    {
#      "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/tui.json",
#      "plugin": ["@lesquel/opencode-pilot@latest"]
#    }
```

OpenCode runs **two separate plugin loaders**: the server loader reads `opencode.json::plugin` (for `server()` exports like the dashboard), and the TUI loader reads `tui.json::plugin` (for `tui()` exports like slash commands). A spec in only one of them gets you half the plugin. Do **not** add wrappers in `<config>/plugins/` — they conflict with the server loader's strict validation.

Run `opencode` from any project directory. Banner prints with URL + token + QR.

> **Going deeper?** [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md) explains OpenCode's two-loader plugin architecture, documents every gotcha we hit, and has a complete troubleshooting matrix. Read it if you're debugging, contributing, or publishing your own OpenCode plugin.

## How to use it day-to-day

Once installed and OpenCode restarted, you have four entry points:

### 1. Slash commands from inside OpenCode TUI

Type any of these at the prompt:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/pilot` | Show the current dashboard URL + token |
| `/pilot-token` | Rotate the auth token (invalidates any open dashboards/phones) |
| `/dashboard` | Same as `/pilot` — alias |
| `/remote` | Print connection info (host, port, tunnel URL if active) |
| `/remote-control` | Full status block with all the above plus QR hint |

### 2. Terminal banner at startup

Every `opencode` launch prints a banner with the dashboard URL, a token, and a QR code. Open the URL in any browser on the same machine, or scan the QR with your phone (requires `PILOT_HOST=0.0.0.0` for LAN — see below).

### 3. The web dashboard itself

Open the URL. Then:

- **`?`** opens the command palette — every action is reachable from there.
- **Left sidebar**: sessions grouped by folder. Click one to switch. `+` creates a new session.
- **Center pane**: the live transcript — user messages appear instantly, the assistant's response streams token by token, tool calls animate pending → running → completed with their inputs and outputs expandable inline.
- **Right panel**: context usage, MCP servers, LSP status, project path, pinned TODOs.
- **Tabs at the top**: open multiple projects in parallel (v1.11+).
- **Gear icon (⚙)**: Settings UI — change port/host, enable tunnel, wire up Telegram bot, generate VAPID keys for Web Push. Everything is editable from here; you rarely need to touch `.env` files anymore.

### 4. From your phone

See [Connect from your phone](#connect-from-your-phone) below. Either same-WiFi (LAN) with `PILOT_HOST=0.0.0.0`, or anywhere with a Cloudflare / ngrok tunnel. The dashboard is mobile-friendly — bottom-sheet modals, 44px tap targets, swipe-to-close. Permissions approvals, prompt sending, session switching all work from the phone.

## Troubleshooting — slash commands don't appear

> **Other symptoms** (port conflicts, `/remote` says "server not running", dashboard 401s, push/telegram silent, wrong tab opens) are covered in [`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md). This section is specifically about the "I installed it but slash commands are missing" case.

If the plugin loads (you see the banner in the terminal) but typing `/remo<Tab>` in the TUI doesn't autocomplete `/remote`, `/dashboard`, `/pilot`, `/pilot-token`, or `/remote-control`:

1. **Check the canary toast**. On startup the TUI should toast "OpenCode Pilot — Remote control plugin loaded". No toast → the TUI plugin didn't register, even if the dashboard server did.

2. **Inspect the latest log**:

   ```bash
   tail -200 $(ls -t ~/.local/share/opencode/log/*.log | head -1) | grep -iE "pilot|tui.plugin|error"
   ```

   - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\opencode\log\<timestamp>.log`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/opencode/<timestamp>.log`

3. **Re-run init**. It cleans up stale wrappers and stale subpath entries left behind by 1.11.x–1.12.x:

   ```bash
   npx @lesquel/opencode-pilot@latest init
   ```

   Then **fully close all OpenCode sessions** (the plugin loader is cached per running process) and reopen.

4. **Verify BOTH `opencode.json::plugin` AND `tui.json::plugin`** each have exactly one entry for the pilot:

   ```json
   "plugin": ["@lesquel/opencode-pilot@latest"]
   ```

   If `tui.json` is missing entirely, the TUI plugin was never registered and slash commands never appear — `init` in 1.13.1+ creates this file. If you see `"@lesquel/opencode-pilot/tui"` anywhere or wrapper paths in the array, the old install pattern got in — `npx init` in step 3 fixes that.

5. **Verify no stale wrappers** in `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`. Safe to delete: `opencode-pilot.ts`, `opencode-pilot-tui.ts`. These were auto-generated by 1.11.x–1.12.x and are no longer needed. `init` does this cleanup automatically.

## Connect from your phone

### Same WiFi (LAN access)

1. Set `PILOT_HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env`
2. Restart OpenCode
3. Click the phone icon in the dashboard header (`c` shortcut)
4. Scan the QR from the "Local network" tab with your phone camera
5. Done — same dashboard, on your phone

### Anywhere (public tunnel)

1. Install [cloudflared](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared) (`brew install cloudflared` on Mac)
2. Add `PILOT_TUNNEL=cloudflared` to your `.env`
3. Restart OpenCode — it spawns the tunnel automatically
4. Phone modal "Public tunnel" tab now has a QR with a public HTTPS URL
5. Works from cellular, hotel WiFi, anywhere

> 🔐 **Security note**: the tunnel URL contains your token. Treat it like a password. See [`docs/TUNNEL_TESTING.md`](docs/TUNNEL_TESTING.md) for security checklist.

## Configuration — two ways

Since **v1.12** you can configure the plugin two ways (or both):

### Easy: the Settings UI

1. Open the dashboard
2. Click the gear icon (⚙) in the header
3. Go to **Plugin configuration**
4. Edit port, host, tunnel, Telegram token, VAPID keys, permission timeout,
   and the glob opener toggle
5. Click **Save** — values are written to `~/.opencode-pilot/config.json`
   and survive restarts

Some fields (port, host, tunnel, VAPID keys) require an OpenCode restart to take effect — the UI shows an inline warning for those. A **Generate VAPID keys** button calls the server to create a key pair in one click.

Each field shows a small badge telling you where its current value comes from: `saved` (UI), `.env`, `shell`, or `default`. Fields set via shell env vars are locked from the UI — you must unset the shell var to override.

### Power user: `.env` file

Full env-var reference with example `.env` files for common scenarios lives in [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](docs/CONFIGURATION.md). Quick overview:

| Variable | Default | What |
|----------|---------|------|
| `PILOT_PORT` | `4097` | HTTP server port |
| `PILOT_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (`0.0.0.0` for LAN) |
| `PILOT_TUNNEL` | (off) | `cloudflared` or `ngrok` for public access |
| `PILOT_PERMISSION_TIMEOUT` | `300000` | Permission-request timeout in ms |
| `PILOT_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` | (off) | Telegram bot token from @BotFather |
| `PILOT_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | (off) | Your Telegram chat ID |
| `PILOT_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | (off) | Web Push public key (`bunx web-push generate-vapid-keys`) |
| `PILOT_VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | (off) | Web Push private key |
| `PILOT_ENABLE_GLOB_OPENER` | `false` | Enable `/fs/glob` for the dashboard's glob search |
| `PILOT_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Timeout for outbound HTTP calls (Telegram, push) |

### Priority (highest wins)

```
1. Shell env vars                         e.g. PILOT_PORT=5000 opencode
2. ~/.opencode-pilot/config.json          written by the Settings UI
3. .env file (process.cwd or plugin dir)  power-user file-based config
4. Hardcoded defaults                     fallback
```

The `.env` file is searched in: (1) `process.cwd()/.env` then (2) the plugin's install dir. Shell env vars always win over both `.env` and the Settings UI.

## Architecture (one line)

The plugin runs ONE HTTP+SSE server inside your OpenCode process. The dashboard is a vanilla ES-modules SPA served from the same origin. All API calls go through the SDK with `?directory=` for multi-project routing.

If you want the deep version, see the [`docs/`](docs/) folder.

---

## Tech stack

- **Server**: Bun + TypeScript (strict)
- **Dashboard**: vanilla ES modules, plain CSS, ~9000 LOC. No React, no build step.
- **Optional deps**: `cloudflared` / `ngrok` (tunnel), `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (MCP), `web-push` (push notifications)
- **Tests**: 228 (Bun test runner), all green
