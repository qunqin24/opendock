An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) **auth plugin** that logs in to **Keycloak**
via OAuth2/OIDC and feeds short-lived, auto-refreshed access tokens to an
**OpenAI-compatible** provider.

It replaces the pattern of pasting a long-lived static JWT as `apiKey`: OpenCode
now obtains a real access token from Keycloak and refreshes it automatically.
**Nothing changes on the provider side** — the Keycloak access token _is_ the JWT
the provider validates (e.g. JWKS + claim policies).

## Features

- **Authorization Code + PKCE (S256)** with a localhost callback (auto-capture),
  plus a **paste-the-code** fallback.
- **Device Authorization Grant** fallback for headless / SSH / container hosts —
  auto-selected (offered first) when no local browser is detected.
- **Automatic refresh, per request**: the loader installs a custom `fetch` that
  refreshes the access token when it expires within 30s (configurable) and
  persists the rotated tokens — on **every** request, not just at startup. A
  long idle (e.g. overnight) never leaves you with a stale token: no restart, no
  re-login.
- **Public client, PKCE only** — no client secret is ever read or stored.
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — only Node built-ins (`node:crypto`,
  `node:http`) and the global `fetch`. Builds and installs **offline** (suitable
  for on-prem / air-gapped environments).
- Credential storage is delegated to OpenCode's native mechanism
  (`auth.json`, mode `0600`).

## Install

> **How OpenCode loads a plugin.** OpenCode resolves a plugin entry either by
> **package name from the npm registry** (needs network access — it downloads the
> package itself, it does _not_ look in your project's or global `node_modules`)
> **or by a filesystem path** to a folder that contains a `package.json` and a
> built `dist/`. For an **offline / air-gapped** host you must use the
> **filesystem-path** form — a bare package name will fail with
> `Unknown provider "<id>"` because OpenCode cannot reach the registry.

### 1. Build the artifact (on a machine with network access)

```bash
npm ci
npm run build          # -> dist/ (ESM + d.ts)
npm pack               # -> opencode-keycloak-auth-<version>.tgz
```

> **Prebuilt artifact (no build needed).** Every [GitHub Release](https://github.com/AyRickk/opencode-keycloak-auth/releases)
> attaches a ready-to-use, self-contained bundle `opencode-keycloak-auth.js`.
> Drop it straight into OpenCode's auto-load directory and configure via
> `OPENCODE_KC_*` env vars (auto-loaded plugins don't receive inline options):
>
> ```bash
> mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugins
> curl -fsSL -o ~/.config/opencode/plugins/keycloak.js \
>   https://github.com/AyRickk/opencode-keycloak-auth/releases/latest/download/opencode-keycloak-auth.js
> ```

### 2. Install it where OpenCode can load it

Pick **one** of the following — all are plain `npm` commands.

**a) From the npm registry (online hosts):** if you publish the package, just
reference it by name in `opencode.json` (`"plugin": ["opencode-keycloak-auth"]`)
and OpenCode downloads it on first run. No manual install step.

**b) Vendored tarball (offline / air-gapped):** install the tarball into a
dedicated folder, then reference the **extracted folder by path**:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.opencode-plugins && cd ~/.opencode-plugins
npm init -y
npm install /path/to/opencode-keycloak-auth-<version>.tgz
# -> ~/.opencode-plugins/node_modules/opencode-keycloak-auth   (contains dist/)
```

Then in `opencode.json` point the plugin at that folder (see below):

```jsonc
"plugin": [["/home/you/.opencode-plugins/node_modules/opencode-keycloak-auth", { /* options */ }]]
```

**c) Local checkout:** after `npm run build`, reference the checkout directory
directly (`"plugin": [["/abs/path/to/opencode-keycloak-auth", { /* options */ }]]`).

> ⚠️ The referenced folder must contain a built `dist/` — OpenCode loads
> `dist/index.js` via the package's `main`. If you skipped `npm run build`, the
> plugin will fail to load.

### Offline note: models.dev

On first run OpenCode fetches `https://models.dev/api.json`. The failure is
**non-fatal** (login still works) but it adds a startup delay and a scary log
line. On air-gapped hosts, silence it:

```bash
export OPENCODE_DISABLE_MODELS_FETCH=1
# or point it at a local copy:
export OPENCODE_MODELS_PATH=/path/to/models.json
```

## Configuration

Everything is configurable via environment variables (prefix `OPENCODE_KC_`)
and/or plugin options in `opencode.json`. **Plugin options take precedence over
environment variables.**

| Env var                       | Plugin option           | Default      | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OPENCODE_KC_ISSUER`          | `issuer`                | — (required) | Realm issuer URL, e.g. `https://kc.example.com/realms/agents` |
| `OPENCODE_KC_CLIENT_ID`       | `clientId`              | — (required) | Public client id                                              |
| `OPENCODE_KC_SCOPES`          | `scopes`                | `openid`     | Space/comma list; `openid` always added                       |
| `OPENCODE_KC_OFFLINE_ACCESS`  | `offlineAccess`         | `true`       | Add `offline_access` for a durable refresh token (see below)  |
| `OPENCODE_KC_PROVIDER_ID`     | `providerId`            | `keycloak`   | Provider id the auth hook attaches to                         |
| `OPENCODE_KC_CALLBACK_HOST`   | `callbackHost`          | `127.0.0.1`  | Localhost callback bind host                                  |
| `OPENCODE_KC_CALLBACK_PORT`   | `callbackPort`          | `49170`      | Localhost callback port (`0` = ephemeral)                     |
| `OPENCODE_KC_REDIRECT_PATH`   | `redirectPath`          | `/callback`  | Redirect path                                                 |
| `OPENCODE_KC_BASE_URL`        | `baseUrl`               | —            | Provider base URL (informational)                             |
| `OPENCODE_KC_REFRESH_LEEWAY`  | `refreshLeewaySeconds`  | `30`         | Refresh this many seconds before expiry                       |
| `OPENCODE_KC_BROWSER_TIMEOUT` | `browserTimeoutSeconds` | `300`        | Browser callback wait timeout                                 |
| `OPENCODE_KC_LOG`             | —                       | `warn`       | Log level: `silent`/`error`/`warn`/`info`/`debug` (see below) |

## Keycloak client setup

Create a client in your realm with:

- **Client type:** OpenID Connect
- **Client authentication:** **OFF** (public client)
- **Standard flow:** **ON** (Authorization Code)
- **OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant:** **ON**
- **PKCE:** Advanced → _Proof Key for Code Exchange Code Challenge Method_ =
  **S256**
- **Valid Redirect URIs:** include the localhost callback, e.g.
  `http://127.0.0.1:49170/callback`
  (add any other ports you configure; for `callbackPort: 0` allow
  `http://127.0.0.1/*`)
- **Web Origins:** not required (no browser-based XHR to Keycloak from the app).

### Staying logged in (offline tokens)

By default the plugin requests the **`offline_access`** scope so a single
`opencode auth login` keeps working across days. This matters because a _regular_
Keycloak refresh token only lives as long as the **SSO session**, which is capped
by the realm's **SSO Session Idle** (default 30 min) and **SSO Session Max**
(default 10h). Leave OpenCode overnight and the session expires, the refresh
fails with `invalid_grant`, and you are forced to log in again every morning.

> Note: the client's **Access Token Lifespan** does _not_ control this — it only
> sets how long each access token is valid, not the refresh token / session.

An **offline token** is exempt from those caps: it is governed instead by
**Offline Session Idle** (default 30 days, refreshed on each use) and, if
enabled, Offline Session Max. That is the difference between "log in once" and
"log in every morning".

Requirements on the Keycloak side:

- The client must have `offline_access` in its **assigned optional client
  scopes** (the realm default for all clients; `fullScopeAllowed` does not affect
  this — it governs role mappings, not client scopes).
- Optionally raise **Offline Session Idle** if 30 days is too short.

Set `OPENCODE_KC_OFFLINE_ACCESS=false` (or `offlineAccess: false`) only for
realms that do not grant `offline_access`.

### Claims required by the provider

A provider that validates the JWT typically checks claims such as **`aud`** and
**roles**. The access token must carry them, which is configured **on the
Keycloak side**, not in this plugin:

- **`aud`** — add the provider audience via a _Client Scope_ with an
  **Audience** mapper (or an _Audience Resolve_ mapper), and request that scope
  (e.g. `OPENCODE_KC_SCOPES="openid aud-api"`).
- **roles** — assign realm/client roles and ensure the relevant role mapper is
  included in the requested scopes.

Verify a freshly issued token with `jwt` tooling and confirm `aud` / `realm_access.roles`
match what your provider's policies expect.

## `opencode.json`

Declare the custom OpenAI-compatible provider and enable the plugin. The first
element of each `plugin` entry is **either** the published package name (online)
**or** a filesystem path to the built folder (offline — see Install):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    [
      // online: "opencode-keycloak-auth"
      // offline: an absolute path to the built folder
      "/home/you/.opencode-plugins/node_modules/opencode-keycloak-auth",
      {
        "issuer": "https://kc.example.com/realms/agents",
        "clientId": "opencode-cli",
        "providerId": "keycloak",
        "scopes": "openid aud-api",
        "callbackPort": 49170,
      },
    ],
  ],
  "provider": {
    "keycloak": {
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "name": "Keycloak",
      "options": {
        "baseURL": "https://api.example.com/v1",
      },
      "models": {
        "qwen2.5-coder-32b": { "name": "Qwen2.5 Coder 32B" },
        "llama-3.3-70b": { "name": "Llama 3.3 70B" },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

> **Provider npm package.** The `provider.keycloak.npm` package
> (`@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`) is fetched by OpenCode the first time you **call a
> model** (not during login). On an air-gapped host, pre-install it the same way
> as the plugin and OpenCode will reuse it from disk.

> The plugin's `provider` (default `keycloak`) **must match** the provider key
> under `"provider"`. The plugin's `loader` returns `{ apiKey: <access_token> }`,
> which the OpenAI-compatible provider sends as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
> to your API.

You can also configure everything via env vars instead of plugin options:

```bash
export OPENCODE_KC_ISSUER="https://kc.example.com/realms/agents"
export OPENCODE_KC_CLIENT_ID="opencode-cli"
export OPENCODE_KC_SCOPES="openid aud-api"
```

## Logging in

```bash
opencode auth login
# pick the "keycloak" provider, then a Keycloak method:
#   - Browser (PKCE, auto-capture)   ← recommended on a workstation
#   - Browser (paste the code)       ← fallback when the port is busy
#   - Device code (headless / SSH)   ← recommended on a server/container
```

On headless hosts (SSH / container / no `DISPLAY`) the **Device code** method is
offered first automatically.

## Logging & diagnostics

The plugin logs to the console (which OpenCode captures), prefixed with
`[keycloak-auth]`. Control verbosity with **`OPENCODE_KC_LOG`**:

| Level            | What you see                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `silent`         | nothing                                                                                                     |
| `error`          | login / refresh failures                                                                                    |
| `warn` (default) | the above **plus** misconfiguration (missing issuer/clientId → provider in error mode) and persist failures |
| `info`           | the above plus successful configuration, logins and token refreshes                                         |
| `debug`          | the above plus the per-request refresh decision and every Keycloak call (never token values)                |

Secrets are never logged — access/refresh tokens and authorization codes are
withheld entirely (or redacted to a short suffix). To trace a refresh problem:

```bash
OPENCODE_KC_LOG=debug opencode --print-logs --log-level DEBUG
```

The default `warn` level exists specifically so the most common failure — a
dropped/incomplete config — is no longer silent: you get
`configuration incomplete — provider "…" registered in ERROR mode (missing: issuer, clientId)`
instead of a provider that mysteriously stops working.

## Troubleshooting

**`Unknown provider "keycloak"` / the provider is missing from `auth login`.**
This means OpenCode never loaded the plugin, so no auth method is registered for
the provider id. The provider block in `opencode.json` alone is _not_ enough —
the login methods come from the plugin. Run the diagnostic:

```bash
opencode auth login -p keycloak --print-logs --log-level DEBUG
```

- A line `failed to load plugin … error="Missing Keycloak issuer …"` → you did
  not pass `issuer`/`clientId` (plugin options or `OPENCODE_KC_*` env vars).
- **No** plugin line at all, and you referenced the plugin by **package name** on
  an offline host → OpenCode tried to fetch it from the registry. Reference it by
  **filesystem path** instead (see Install).

Since this plugin now registers the provider even when the config is incomplete,
selecting the **`⚠ not configured`** method prints the exact missing value.

**`Unexpected server error` every morning / after being idle, fixed by
re-running `opencode auth login`.** The stored refresh token was rejected with
`invalid_grant` because the Keycloak **SSO session expired** overnight (idle or
max lifespan). This is a realm/session setting, not a plugin bug — note it also
affects OpenCode's native MCP OAuth against the same realm. Fix it durably with
an **offline token**: keep `offline_access` enabled (the default) and make sure
the client is granted that scope. See _Staying logged in (offline tokens)_.

**`Unauthorized` (401) after a long idle, fixed by **restarting** OpenCode — no
`auth login` needed.** Distinct from the case above (that one needs a re-login).
Here the stored refresh token is still valid — restarting refreshes it fine —
but the running process was serving a token frozen at startup. This was a plugin
bug fixed in **v0.4.1**: OpenCode calls the auth `loader` only once (when it
memoizes the SDK client), so a static `apiKey` never got refreshed at runtime and
expired mid-session. The loader now installs a custom `fetch` that refreshes per
request. Upgrade to ≥ 0.4.1 and reload the plugin.

**Auth suddenly fails / the provider "stops working" after it used to be fine.**
Most often the config was dropped (env vars unset, or the plugin options removed
from `opencode.json`), so the plugin loads in **error mode** with no loader. Since
v0.3.0 this is logged at `warn`: look for
`configuration incomplete — provider "…" registered in ERROR mode (missing: …)`.
Restore `OPENCODE_KC_ISSUER`/`OPENCODE_KC_CLIENT_ID` (or the plugin options) and
re-run. Run with `OPENCODE_KC_LOG=debug` to trace the token refresh lifecycle.

**`Failed to fetch models.dev`.** Harmless — see the offline note in Install. Set
`OPENCODE_DISABLE_MODELS_FETCH=1` to silence it.

## How it maps to the OpenCode auth API

This plugin targets `@opencode-ai/plugin` ≥ 1.17 (`AuthHook`):

- `provider` — the provider id to attach to.
- `methods[]` — three `oauth` methods: browser auto-capture (`method: "auto"`),
  browser paste (`method: "code"`), and device flow (`method: "auto"` whose
  `callback()` polls the token endpoint).
- `loader(auth, provider)` — OpenCode calls this **once**, when it builds and
  memoizes the provider's SDK client (not before every request). Returning a bare
  `{ apiKey }` would freeze that access token for the life of the process, so the
  loader instead returns a **custom `fetch`** that re-resolves and refreshes the
  token on **every** outgoing request (reading stored tokens, refreshing when near
  expiry, and persisting via `client.auth.set(...)`). Freshness is therefore
  independent of how often OpenCode invokes the loader.

## Development

Requires **Node.js >= 20**.

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck
npm test          # vitest, fetch/clock fully injected — no network, no real timers
npm run build     # tsup -> dist/ (ESM + d.ts)
npm run lint
npm run format
```

Run the full pre-PR check (mirrors CI) in one line:

```bash
npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm test && npm run build
```
