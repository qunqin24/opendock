> 🤝 **Your OpenCode just hired a team.**
>
> Six specialized agents — a Lead, an Architect, an Implementer, a Reviewer, a Tester and a Researcher — with governed tools, structured handoffs, and a plan-first approval gate. One plugin, zero config files to copy.

> 💡 **Best for medium-to-large projects.** The governance layer (approval gate, context offload, tool allowlists) is an asset once a codebase has real surface area — and mostly overhead on tiny scripts and one-off questions. Use it where the work is.

## TL;DR — skip the docs

> **The lazy path:** paste this to any coding agent and let it do the work:
>
> ```text
> Install the OpenCode plugin @te-river/opencode-team-mode following
> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Te-River/Opencode-TeamMode/main/docs/installation.md
> Then verify the install using the checks in that guide.
> ```
>
> **The one command to remember afterwards:** `/team-run <task>` — the Team Lead
> plans it, shows you the plan, waits for your approval, then runs the whole team.

## 🤔 Why TeamMode?

Because a single agent doing everything is how you get: a context window stuffed
with 5000-line file dumps, twenty round-trips to `bash` for what one script could
do, sub-agents that silently read `.env`, and web "research" that is really just
the model's imagination.

TeamMode's answer to each:

| Pain | TeamMode's answer |
|---|---|
| 🔥 **Context flooding** | Every governed tool output over its content-class offload threshold (prose 4000 / data 2000 tokens, CJK-aware) is offloaded to a local run store and replaced by an 80-token preview + an HMAC handle. The agent pages through what it needs — the window never drowns. |
| 🐌 **Round-trip overhead** | `tm_ptc_run`: the agent writes ONE program that makes N governed calls in a single turn. Zero LLM round-trips during the run. |
| 🕳️ **Silent side effects** | R6/R2 approval gate: env-var reads and dangerous ops route through OpenCode's official confirmation dialog, auto-rejected after 1 unanswered minute (default). The plugin never approves on its own — it only ever rejects. |
| 🌫️ **Hallucinated research** | Web access is a two-role grant with an allowlisted, governed tool chain. A fact that couldn't be fetched is reported as a gap — never fabricated. |
| 🧭 **Walls of text** | Replies are steered into the shape the host renders fastest: a markdown table for per-file / per-case / per-finding results, fenced code for diffs and configs, a browser screenshot attached as an inline image only when you ask for one. The host does not draw mermaid, so no agent pretends it does. |

And the workflow discipline underneath: deterministic routing, a ≤30-line plan
you approve before ≥2 dispatches execute, structured `STATUS/CHANGES/FINDINGS/
EVIDENCE/HANDOFF` replies between agents, and static verification (build /
typecheck / tests) instead of vibes.

That discipline is also why the recommendation is **medium-to-large
projects**: on a two-file script the team simply has less to govern.

## 👥 The team

| Agent | Role | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| 🎯 **Team Lead** (`@team`) | Orchestrator | Complex tasks that need planning + multi-step execution |
| 🏗️ **Architect** | System designer | Design docs, module structure, API contracts |
| 💻 **Implementer** | Code writer | Building features, writing production code |
| 🔍 **Reviewer** | Dimension-focused auditor | Single-dimension review by default; 3 in parallel only for high-risk changes |
| 🧪 **Tester** | Test engineer | Tests with real edge cases; static verification (build / typecheck / lint); governed UI verification via `tm_browser` |
| 🔎 **Researcher** | Knowledge finder | Local repo first, then the web — one of the two network roles (with the Lead) |

Out of the box, **Team is your default agent** — new chats open straight into the
orchestrator (opt-out in [Configuration](#-configuration)).

---

## 📦 Install

### Option 1 — Let your agent do it (recommended)

Copy this into any coding agent — it will edit your config, restart-remind you, and verify:

```text
Install the OpenCode plugin @te-river/opencode-team-mode following
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Te-River/Opencode-TeamMode/main/docs/installation.md
(If that URL is unreachable — common on mainland-China networks — retry with
the mirror prefix: https://ghproxy.net/ + the same path.)
Then verify the install using the checks in that guide.
```

(The guide is the complete manual procedure — config file locations, plugin
entry, restart, verification, update and uninstall. Your agent reads it and
executes it faithfully; there is nothing else it needs.)

### Option 2 — One-line script

macOS / Linux (bash):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ghproxy.net/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Te-River/Opencode-TeamMode/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://ghproxy.net/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Te-River/Opencode-TeamMode/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Option 3 — Manual

Add the plugin to your `opencode.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": [
    "@te-river/opencode-team-mode@latest"
  ]
}
```

OpenCode installs the plugin on next startup.

### ⚠️ Read this once, save yourself an hour later

- **Restart to activate.** After touching `opencode.json`, fully quit and restart OpenCode (Desktop: quit from tray, not just the window).
- **Plugin updates: re-run the installer.** It is idempotent — a re-run re-patches the config (no-op when present), purges the stale plugin cache, and re-resolves any npm-installed copy. This exists because OpenCode caches plugins by spec string and does NOT re-resolve `@latest` when a new version publishes (upstream limitation). Manual recipe, if you prefer:

  | OS | Purge command — recursive, covers BOTH cache layouts |
  |---|---|
  | macOS / Linux | `find ~/.cache/opencode/packages -type d -name '*opencode-team-mode*' -prune -exec rm -rf {} +` |
  | Windows (PowerShell) | `foreach ($r in "$HOME\.cache\opencode\packages", "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\opencode\cache\packages") { if (Test-Path $r) { Get-ChildItem $r -Directory -Recurse -Filter '*opencode-team-mode*' -EA SilentlyContinue | Sort-Object { $_.FullName.Length } | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -EA SilentlyContinue } }` |

  ⚠️ OpenCode loads the plugin from `~/.cache/opencode/packages/` — possibly nested inside the scoped `@te-river/` directory — **not** from `~/.config/opencode/node_modules`, which is why the delete must recurse (a top-level-only `rm -rf` silently misses the scoped copy).

  If you also npm-installed the plugin into `~/.config/opencode`, its package-lock pins the version — run `npm install @te-river/opencode-team-mode@latest` there too. Full recipe (including an agent-driven update prompt): [installation guide, Updating](./docs/installation.md).
- **Prerequisites:** [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) (Desktop or CLI) and Node ≥ 18.

### Verify

Restart, open the agent picker, and look for **team, architect, implementer,
reviewer, tester, researcher**. That's it — the team is hired.

---

## 📖 Usage

### Slash commands

| Command | Agent | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/team-plan <task>` | Architect | Implementation plan with architecture, file manifest, task breakdown |
| `/team-implement <task>` | Implementer | Production code for a feature or task |
| `/team-review [scope]` | Reviewer | Audit for bugs, security issues, quality problems |
| `/team-test [scope]` | Tester | Comprehensive tests with edge-case coverage |
| `/team-research <topic>` | Researcher | Local repo first; web via the governed tools |
| `/team-run <task>` | Team Lead | **The full workflow** — plan → approval → orchestration → verification |

Or `@`-mention agents directly: `@team`, `@architect`, `@implementer`,
`@reviewer`, `@tester`, `@researcher`.

### What a run feels like

Team is the default agent out of the box, so you just type into a fresh chat:

> **You:** Add token-bucket rate limiting to our Express API — 100 requests per minute per user, return 429 when exceeded. Don't touch anything under `src/legacy/`.

```text
team   Route: product behavior change → implementer → tester → reviewer
       (3 dispatches → approval gate applies)

       PLAN
       Goal: token-bucket limiter, 100 req/min/user, 429 + Retry-After
       Scope: src/middleware/rateLimit.ts (new), src/app.ts (+3 lines)
       Pipeline: implementer → tester → reviewer (correctness)
       Assumption: in-memory bucket, not Redis — say the word to change
       Boundary: src/legacy/** untouched
       Approve to proceed?

you    approved, go

team   ▸ @implementer — STATUS: done
       CHANGES: src/middleware/rateLimit.ts (new) · src/app.ts (+3)
       EVIDENCE: tsc clean

       ▸ @tester — STATUS: done · VERDICT: pass (14/14)
       FINDINGS: burst edge, window expiry, concurrent refill covered;
                 src/legacy/** byte-identical

       ▸ @reviewer — STATUS: done · VERDICT: approve (correctness)

team   Done. rateLimit.ts (new) · app.ts (+3) · 14 tests green
       review: approve · assumption: in-memory only · src/legacy/ untouched
```

You typed the task and four words. The plan was a routing-table lookup,
execution waited for your approval, and every handoff between agents traveled
as a structured skeleton — nothing landed in your repo, nothing was guessed.

## 🧰 Governed tools & security

Every tool TeamMode adds runs under ONE governance pipeline: outputs above
the offload threshold never enter the context window — the boundary is
content-class aware (`TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_TEXT` = 4000 for prose:
text/log/markdown; `TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_DATA` = 2000 for json/csv/code/
binary; an unknown class falls back to the global `TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD`) —
and oversized results are offloaded to a run store and replaced by a
content-aware preview plus an HMAC-signed handle that the agent pages
through with `tm_fetch` when it genuinely needs the payload.

| Tool | What it does | Roles |
|---|---|---|
| `tm_read` / `tm_grep` / `tm_bash` / `tm_fetch` | Governed file read / regex search / read-only shell (allowlist) / paged handle retrieval (JSON handles take a `fields` dot-path projection — a deliberately small jq subset like `items[].name`) | all six agents |
| `tm_memory` | Session + project + global memory store (Markdown + frontmatter): add / search / list / forget / compact | all six agents |
| `tm_ptc_run` | Batch orchestration: one program, N governed calls, zero LLM round-trips; web roles also get `tm.search` / `tm.webfetch` inside the program | all six agents |
| `tm_search` | Multi-engine web search with extracted, deduplicated, RRF-fused hit lists | Lead + Researcher |
| `tm_webfetch` | Single governed GET of an allowlisted page (search pages auto-extracted) | Lead + Researcher |
| `tm_dispatch` / `tm_join` | **Async sub-agent dispatch**: `tm_dispatch` starts a specialist in its own child session and returns the id immediately (the built-in `task` tool blocks you until it finishes), `tm_join` collects — status snapshot, bounded `waitMs`, `cancel:true` to abort a runaway child; collected replies ride the offload pipeline, so five fat reports arrive as handles + previews instead of multiplying your context. Lead-only, and a child never dispatches | Lead only |
| `tm_pty` | **Non-blocking command execution** on the host's own terminal sessions (`start`/`status`/`list`/`kill`) — independent builds and test suites overlap instead of queueing behind one 120 s bash call. Captures no output (the command tees its own log; read it with `tm_read`), and every start passes the R6 classifier, the R2 danger-face globs **and** the official confirmation dialog before a process exists | Lead only |
| `tm_browser` | Interactive browser session (**your default browser**): 16 Playwright verbs (snapshot-first `take_snapshot` → uid-addressed `click`/`fill`/`drag`/…) + 5 legacy compat verbs (open/navigate/read/screenshot/close); Playwright engine needs Node ≥ 20, below that (or on any import failure) it auto-degrades to the legacy CDP engine. It drives YOUR default browser channel (an Edge Beta default opens Edge Beta), stays headful unless the operator sets `TM_BROWSER_HEADLESS`, loads a page's own images/CSS/JS via the `same-site` subresource policy, and `take_screenshot { image:true }` attaches a JPEG so the model can actually see the screen | Lead + Researcher + Tester (UI verification) |

> **Fixed tool priority ladder (every task): ① TeamMode governed tools
> (`tm_*`) → ② user MCP/plugin tools → ③ the model's own reasoning.**
> It doubles as the fallback chain: when a governed tool errors (no browser
> on this host, blocked host), the agent says so and drops to the next rung.

All governed tools are **parallel-safe**: the host may run a batch of
`tm_search` / `tm_webfetch` / `tm_fetch` calls concurrently — each call gets
its own step id and its own payload, and nothing cross-contaminates
(proven by the parallel test suite).

### Context governance: offload, handles, previews

Large tool outputs are context cost's main driver — every step re-sends the
whole window. So results above the content-class offload boundary (prose →
`TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_TEXT`, structured data → `TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_DATA`,
unknown → global `TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD`) are written to a local run store
(`<repo>/.git/opencode-team/`, never your working tree) and replaced by a
handle with a content-aware preview: JSON keys / CSV header + shape / log
ERROR×N stats / code signatures / binary metadata, hard-capped at 80 tokens.
When the agent actually needs the payload, it pages through with `tm_fetch`
using an HMAC-signed, run-scoped, expiring handle — and on a JSON handle it
can ask for a `fields` dot-path projection instead (a deliberately small jq
subset: `items[].name`, `[].stargazers_count`), so a big API dump narrows to
just the values needed without the raw body ever entering the window.
`tm_bash` only allows read-only commands (allowlist), and failures come back
as structured errors instead of raw dumps.

### Session + project + global memory (tm_memory)

Durable facts — build commands, environment quirks, architecture decisions,
your conventions — live as human-editable Markdown with frontmatter, in
THREE tiers:

- **`session`**: this conversation's transients only — in-process, TTL-swept
  (`TM_MEMORY_SESSION_TTL_MIN`, default 240 min), invisible to other
  sessions; ephemeral unless `TM_MEMORY_SESSION_PERSIST=1` writes them under
  `memories/sessions/<sid>/`.
- **`project`** (default): `<repo>/.git/opencode-team/memories/…` — per checkout, git-adjacent. Facts about THIS repo: build commands, environment quirks, architecture decisions.
- **`global`**: `~/.opencode-team/memories/global/` (override `TM_MEMORY_GLOBAL_DIR`) — **follows you across ALL projects**. User-level conventions: preferred package manager, commit style, tooling habits.

Actions: `add` / `search` (deterministic keyword scoring) / `list` / `forget` /
`compact`; 4000 chars per memory. `search` walks ALL tiers with **session >
project > global precedence** — project entries get a +2 near-tie weight and a
same-title higher-layer twin shadows the lower one (it never surfaces).
Near-duplicates never pile up: an `add` that hits an existing entry in the same
tier and category (dedup key, or title+keywords Jaccard ≥ 0.6) **folds into
it** — new content wins, keywords union, the old slug moves to `supersedes:`,
and the answer says 已合并 (that is normal; don't re-add under a variant title).
When a tier reaches `TM_MEMORY_MAX_ENTRIES` (200 per scope) the add fails on
purpose: run `compact` first — it dry-runs the merge plan by default, and
re-running with `apply:true` performs it after copying every original to a
timestamped `.compact-backup` tree (the rollback path). Entries older than
`TM_MEMORY_STALE_DAYS` (30) surface tagged `[stale Nd]` in search. Agents
are prompted to search before assuming conventions and to save hard-won
facts for the next conversation.

### 🌐 Web search that actually works (in China)

`tm_search` is the open-ended-lookup front: **one call, one query, clean
results**. The engine URL is built for you, fetched through the governed
pipeline, and collapsed into a numbered title+URL hit list — the agent never
sees raw SERP chrome.

| Engine | Notes |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | Classifies the query, fans the matching engines out **in parallel** (every route has ≥2 legs), dedupes by host+path and fuses them with weighted RRF into a top-10 list tagged with each hit's source engine(s).  Ranking is scaled by real query-token overlap (floor `TM_SEARCH_RELEVANCE_FLOOR`), so a trusted engine's off-topic junk no longer outranks another engine's best hit. Routing: errors / camelCase APIs → `stackoverflow`+`github`+`bing`; dev-ecosystem (releases, frameworks, open source) → `hn`+`github`+`npm`; Chinese → `bing`+`moegirl`+`stackoverflow`+`hn`; other → `bing`+`stackoverflow`+`hn`+`github`. Pin another default via `TM_SEARCH_DEFAULT_ENGINE` |
| `bing` | cn.bing.com — the only live CN HTML SERP; multi-word CJK queries get their phrase boundary protected (quoted) so markup shuffle can't split the result list |
| `stackoverflow` | api.stackexchange.com question search (no key, 300/day/IP) → numbered questions with composite snippets; `auto` tracks the quota and swaps in `bing` once spent |
| `hn` | Hacker News via Algolia API (no key) → story titles + snippets with direct article URLs |
| `bilibili` | video search |
| `moegirl` | MediaWiki search API — entry titles + snippets, structured |
| `npm` | registry search → name@version + description, structured |
| `github` | repo search API → stars + description, structured; `org:` / `user:` / `stars:` / `language:` qualifiers fold into the query (e.g. `vector db stars:>500 language:rust`) |

All seven engines are reachable from mainland China **without API keys**, and
every one of them sits on the seeded domain allowlist. The previous CN HTML
SERPs (`sogou` / `so` / `baidu` / `bing-int`) were **removed** — a live
benchmark (2026-09-14) showed them serving anti-bot shells or 100% empty
results; they are not even manually selectable. On an empty result,
the error names the alternative engines instead of leaving the agent stuck.
Two more channels complete the surface:

- `tm_webfetch` — a known URL, one governed GET. Search-engine pages it
  fetches are auto-extracted to hit lists too. JSON endpoints like
  `registry.npmjs.org/<pkg>/latest` pass through untouched.
- `tm_browser` — JS-rendered pages: **your DEFAULT browser** (Windows
  registry / Linux `xdg-settings`; Chromium-family only — Firefox falls back
  to the Edge/Chrome probe order because CDP is Chromium-proprietary;
  `TM_BROWSER_PATH` overrides), headful by default, isolated temp profile,
  **domain allowlist enforced at the network layer** per request and per
  redirect hop. The action surface is chrome-devtools-mcp aligned: **16
  Playwright verbs** (`navigate_page` · `take_snapshot` · `click` · `fill` ·
  `hover` · `drag` · `press_key` · `select_page` · `upload_file` · `wait_for`
  · `evaluate_script` · `list_console_messages` · `list_network_requests` ·
  `list_pages` · `take_screenshot` · `handle_dialog`) plus 5 legacy compat
  verbs (`open` / `navigate` / `read` / `screenshot` / `close`).
  Snapshot-first: `take_snapshot` returns the aria snapshot with injected
  `[uid=eN]` tokens, follow-up actions address nodes by uid instead of
  guessed locators; snapshots are hard-capped by
  `TM_BROWSER_SNAPSHOT_MAX_TOKENS` (default 1200).
  **Engine split:** the primary engine is `playwright-core` (an optional
  dependency — needs **Node ≥ 20**; on older Node, or if the import fails,
  the session auto-degrades per instance to the zero-dep `cdp-legacy`
  engine, which keeps the core verbs only; pin either via
  `TM_BROWSER_ENGINE=playwright|cdp-legacy`). No browser download is ever
  involved — Playwright launches YOUR installed browser by path, so
  `npx playwright install` is not part of the user flow (the dependency
  itself resolves at npm install/publish time). Isolated temp profile by
  default: persistent logins only if you explicitly set
  `TM_BROWSER_USER_DATA_DIR`.

When a fetch still returns **403 after the real-Chrome headers**, the error
is a DIRECTIVE: the gate is JS-challenge / TLS-fingerprint based and only a
real browser passes — the agent is told to call `tm_browser`
(`action:"open"` → `action:"read"`) for that URL. Search hit lists also
filter known noise: engine-internal wrappers (`so.com/link?`, `ai.so.com`)
and same-name-different-site domains (`maimai.cn` 脉脉 vs the maimai DX
game) never ride along — extend the hit blacklist with `TM_HIT_BLACKLIST`.

Seeded allowlist (all three web tools; 23 hosts — baidu/moegirl/bilibili are
PARENT domains, so every sibling subdomain — baike.baidu.com,
mzh.moegirl.org.cn, space.bilibili.com — is covered):
`baidu.com`, `moegirl.org.cn`, `bilibili.com`, `www.sogou.com`, `www.so.com`,
`cn.bing.com`, `www.bing.com`, `zhihu.com`, `juejin.cn`, `csdn.net`,
`cnblogs.com`, `gitee.com`, `github.com`, `api.github.com`,
`raw.githubusercontent.com`, `gist.githubusercontent.com`, `ghproxy.net`
(mainland mirror for github raw), `stackoverflow.com`, `api.stackexchange.com`
+ `hn.algolia.com` (the two JSON search engines), `npmjs.org`, `pypi.org`,
`learn.microsoft.com` — extend via
`TM_WEBFETCH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` (`"*"` opens every host; a custom list REPLACES
the seed, so keep the engine hosts or `tm_search` loses its targets). Architect /
implementer / reviewer have NO network grant — web questions come back as a
reported gap, never simulated. The tester carries `tm_browser` ONLY, for
governed UI verification of the project (local dev servers, preview routes);
open web fetching stays with the two network roles.

**Out-of-allowlist targets are a gate, not a wall.** When a fetch / search /
browser-open points at a host outside the allowlist, the tool hands the URL
to OpenCode's **official confirmation dialog** — you decide, once per
target (an unanswered dialog is auto-rejected on the usual 1-minute timer,
and the plugin still never self-allows). Every dialog also fires a
**system toast notification**, so you know something is waiting even when
you're not staring at the screen. Env-file URLs and non-http(s) schemes
remain hard-rejected with no dialog — R6 red lines are never consentable.

### Security: the R6 + R2 approval gate

**R6 environment protection.** With TeamMode active, the model cannot read
environment variables silently. Env reads (`printenv`, `env`, `Get-ChildItem
env:`, …) and env files (`.env`, shell rc) route through OpenCode's official
confirmation dialog; unanswered prompts are **auto-rejected after
`TM_ASK_TIMEOUT_MIN` (default 1 min)**. Env reads no wildcard can express
(embedded `$VAR` / `${VAR}` / `$env:` inside another command, command
substitution) and the `tm_*` wrapper channel stay a **hard block** — no dialog
to slip through. The audit log records only tool name + pattern category +
verdict — never command text, paths, variable names or values. Verdicts now
also explain a dialog that cannot be answered anymore: a reply that hits an
**already-closed** dialog (host 404 — the timer already auto-rejected) audits
as `already-closed` without degrading the gate, a plugin-side bad reply shape
audits as `rejected-shape-bug`, and a user reply that arrives *after* the
auto-reject is recorded as `late-<verdict>` for observability only (the
rejection stands — the plugin still never self-allows). The 1-minute auto-reject
floor is tunable via `TM_ASK_TIMEOUT_FLOOR_MIN`; the short default is safe
because a reply that races the timer audits as benign `already-closed` (host
404 on a closed dialog — no gate degrade), and the observed ~120 s is the
host-to-plugin event-bus *delivery* lag, not click-resolution latency.

**R2 dangerous operations (same dialog).** Delete, git publish, network
fetch, package install/publish, process/system, privilege changes — none are
silently allowed. The normal verification stack (`npm test`, `tsc`,
`git status`) is NOT gated, so day-to-day work runs uninterrupted.

> ⚠️ **When you approve a dialog, pick "once" — not "always".** Verified on
> the live host, "always" records a far broader rule than the command you
> saw: approving `Get-ChildItem env:PATH` with "always" stores `Get-ChildItem
> *`, so every later `Get-ChildItem` runs with no dialog at all.

> Deferral to the dialog is per-session: env reads only route to the dialog
> in sessions running TeamMode's injected agents. In any other session the
> guard keeps hard-blocking env reads. `headless opencode run` auto-rejects
> unanswered `ask`s immediately (there is no human to prompt).

### Repo hygiene

The offload/trajectory/memory stores live under `<repo>/.git/opencode-team/`
(or the OS temp dir outside a git repo) — **never your working tree**. Every
agent is instructed to delete scratch files before reporting done and to keep
throwaway work in the OS temp dir. A TTL sweeper reclaims old task dirs at
startup + hourly; the Team Lead never deletes boards itself, so you can audit
any run.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The plugin injects everything at startup — no agent files to copy.

> **Model choice matters.** Every judgment — triage, decomposition, dispatch
> briefs, synthesis, review verdicts — flows through the Team Lead. A weak
> model in that seat degrades the whole pipeline no matter how strong the
> specialists are. Pin your best reasoning model to `team`:

```jsonc
{
  "agent": {
    "team": { "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5" },      // Lead earns your best model
    "implementer": { "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6" } // specialists tolerate cheaper
  }
}
```

**Global install** — put the plugin entry in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` and every project gets the team.

**Keep Team off the default slot:**

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": [
    ["@te-river/opencode-team-mode@latest", { "defaultAgent": false }]
  ]
}
```

Your own agents named `team` / `architect` / … always take precedence; the
plugin never clobbers user definitions. See [Customization](#-customization)
for overrides, extra agents and disabling roles.

### Environment variables

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TM_ENV_PROTECT` | `strict` | R6 mode: `strict` / `standard` / `off` (off also disarms the approval timer) |
| `TM_ASK_TIMEOUT_MIN` | `1` | minutes before an unanswered dialog is auto-rejected (floored at 1 min — safe: a racing reply audits as benign `already-closed`; the host's reply event reaching the plugin ~120 s late is event-bus delivery lag, not a click delay) |
| `TM_ASK_TIMEOUT_FLOOR_MIN` | `1` | minimum enforced for the ask timeout above |
| `TM_ENV_PROTECT_EXTRA_DENY` | — | extra block patterns (regex; always hard block, never dialog-governed) |
| `TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD` | `2000` | global offload fallback (tokens, CJK-aware estimate) — used when the content class is unknown |
| `TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_TEXT` | `4000` | offload boundary for prose (text / log / markdown) |
| `TM_OFFLOAD_THRESHOLD_DATA` | `2000` | offload boundary for structured payloads (json / csv / code / binary) |
| `TM_PREVIEW_MAX_TOKENS` | `80` | preview hard cap |
| `TM_FETCH_MAX_LINES` | `2000` | tm_fetch page cap |
| `TM_BLACKBOARD_DIR` / `TM_TRAJECTORY_DIR` | `<repo>/.git/opencode-team/…` | offload store / trajectory ledger (tmpdir fallback; explicit = absolute or project-relative) |
| `TM_BLACKBOARD_TTL` | `7` | store retention (days) |
| `TM_BASH_READONLY_ALLOWED` | built-in table | tm_bash allowlist |
| `TM_SEARCH_DEFAULT_ENGINE` | `auto` | tm_search engine when no `engine` arg is given (`auto` = classify + parallel fan-out + RRF fusion; any table name also pins a manual default) |
| `TM_WEBFETCH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` | the 23 seeded hosts | tm_webfetch / tm_search / tm_browser allowlist (`"*"` opens all; empty = deny all; a custom list REPLACES the seed — keep the engine hosts) |
| `TM_BROWSER_PATH` | auto-detect | tm_browser executable override (default: your DEFAULT browser when Chromium-family, else Edge/Chrome probes) |
| `TM_BROWSER_HEADLESS` | `auto` | `1` headless (CI) / `0` headful / `auto` (headless only on display-less Linux) |
| `TM_BROWSER_ENGINE` | `playwright` | `playwright` (needs Node ≥ 20; any import failure auto-degrades) / `cdp-legacy` (zero-dep CDP pipe, core verbs only) |
| `TM_BROWSER_SNAPSHOT_MAX_TOKENS` | `1200` | hard cap on `take_snapshot` payloads |
| `TM_BROWSER_SUBRESOURCE` | `same-site` | what a page may load after its navigation was allowed: `same-site` = images/media/fonts/stylesheets always, scripts/XHR only for a site this session actually opened; `passive` = only the passive types; `off` = the legacy every-request gate. Blocked requests surface as a "N 个子资源请求被拦截" note on the next snapshot |
| `TM_BROWSER_IDLE_MS` | `180000` | an untouched browser session closes itself after this many ms (0 disables) and tells the user — a window nobody owns is a user-facing bug |
| `TM_BROWSER_IMAGE_MAX_BYTES` | `400000` | ceiling on the JPEG `take_screenshot { image:true }` inlines into the model's context (above it the reply stays path-only and says why) |
| `TM_SEARCH_WEIGHTS` | unset | per-engine fusion weight overrides, e.g. `bing=0.3,hn=0.25`; anything unset keeps the built-in table |
| `TM_SEARCH_RELEVANCE_FLOOR` | `0.35` | weight fraction kept by a hit that shares no query token with its title/snippet/host (demotes junk without deleting an engine) |
| `TM_SEARCH_MAX_HITS` | `10` | hits kept per engine leg and in the fused list |
| `TM_SEARCH_DISABLED_ENGINES` | unset | engines removed from the roster AND from every `auto` route (`sogou,baidu` style) |
| `TM_BASH_TIMEOUT_PROBE_MS` | `60000` | ceiling forced onto a `timeout` the model set for a read-only probe command (0 disables) |
| `TM_BASH_TIMEOUT_MAX_MS` | `0` | optional global ceiling for every other bash command — off by default so a real build keeps the timeout it asked for |
| `TM_PTY_MAX` | `4` | concurrent `tm_pty` terminal sessions this plugin may keep running at once |
| `TM_TOOL_HINTS` | `on` | append TeamMode's call-site discipline to the built-in `bash` / `task` tool DESCRIPTIONS via `tool.definition` (append-only, idempotent — the host text is never replaced) |
| `TM_AGENT_TEMPERATURE` | `off` | `on` applies a per-role sampling table (architect 0.35 / researcher 0.3 / reviewer 0.1 / rest 0.2) via `chat.params`; or give it `reviewer=0.05;team=0.4`. Off = the documented "all agents at 0.2" invariant stands |
| `TM_COMPACTION_CONTEXT` | `on` | on the host's pre-compaction hook, add the must-survive list (reply skeleton, offload handles, dispatched child session ids, provenance, board paths). Additive — the host's own summarizer prompt is never replaced |
| `TM_COMPACTION_AUTOCONTINUE` | `on` | `off` stops the host from silently resuming the turn after a compaction, so a human re-reads state first |
| `TM_SHELL_NO_COLOR` | `on` | inject `NO_COLOR`/`TERM=dumb` into every child shell via `shell.env` (ANSI progress bars are pure context tax). Never overwrites a value the host already set |
| `TM_SHELL_ENV` | — | explicit `KEY=VALUE;KEY2=VALUE2` passthrough into child shells — deliberately allowlisted, so this hook can't become a side channel for the parent environment |
| `TM_BROWSER_USER_DATA_DIR` | — (isolated temp profile) | explicit persistent profile dir — the ONLY way logins survive between sessions |
| `TM_MEMORY_GLOBAL_DIR` | `~/.opencode-team/memories/global/` | tm_memory GLOBAL tier store |
| `TM_MEMORY_SESSION_TTL_MIN` | `240` | session-tier entry TTL (lazy + boot sweep) |
| `TM_MEMORY_MAX_ENTRIES` | `200` | per-scope entry cap; over it `add` fails on purpose — run `compact` |
| `TM_MEMORY_STALE_DAYS` | `30` | age after which search hits are tagged `[stale Nd]` (`0` disables) |
| `TM_MEMORY_SESSION_PERSIST` | — (ephemeral) | `1` also writes session entries under `memories/sessions/<sid>/` |
| `TM_HIT_BLACKLIST` | `maimai.cn` | extra domains never listed as search hits (comma/semicolon separated; same-name-different-site noise like 脉脉) |
| `TM_PTC_MAX_PROGRAM_CHARS` | `4000` | PTC program source cap |
| `TM_PTC_MAX_CALLS` | `20` | PTC per-run bridge-call budget (1–200) |
| `TM_PTC_MAX_ERRORS` | `3` | PTC per-run error budget (1–50) |
| `TM_PTC_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | PTC per-run wall-clock timeout (5s–10min) |
| `TM_PTC_ENGINE` | `auto` | `auto` (worker→inline degrade) / `worker` / `inline` |
| `TM_PTC_WEB_BRIDGE` | `on` | expose `tm.search` / `tm.webfetch` to PTC programs (`off` removes them from the bridge set) |

## 🏗️ How the team works

Sub-agents can't message each other live (platform limitation), so TeamMode
coordinates them through a **structured reply skeleton** — every specialist
reply is `STATUS: / CHANGES: / FINDINGS: / EVIDENCE: / HANDOFF:`, ≤50 lines,
relayed verbatim by the Lead into the next dispatch. Files are the exception,
not the rule: a deliverable over ~50 lines goes to ONE named board file under
`<repo>/.git/opencode-team/` (round-suffixed, working tree untouched).

- **Routing table:** question → direct answer; docs-only → implementer;
  product change → implementer → tester → reviewer; multi-module →
  architect → implementer → tester → reviewer(s); unknown tech → researcher
  first. Fixed minimums — a product change routed below 3 dispatches is a
  routing bug.
- **Approval gate (count-based):** ≥2 dispatches → plan (≤30 lines) → **your
  approval** → execute. Blocking questions are batched and asked immediately.
- **Concurrent dispatch:** independent dispatches batch into the SAME round
  (parallel implementers with per-file ownership + verbatim contracts,
  3-dimension reviews, split test suites); only the Team Lead dispatches —
  specialists no longer hold `task`, so no sub-agent spawns a sub-agent.
- **Adaptive review:** one reviewer by default; three parallel dimensions
  only for high-risk profiles (auth/security, cross-module contracts, public APIs).
- **Static verification:** build / typecheck / lint / tests. Improvised
  browser automation is banned; unverified UI work ends with
  `UI NOT VERIFIED: <what to check>`.
- **Evidence standard:** "done / fixed / passed" claims need verifiable
  evidence — output, logs, diffs.

## 🔧 Customization

**Override an agent** — same name in your config wins:

```jsonc
{
  "agent": {
    "reviewer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "prompt": "You are an extremely strict reviewer. Reject anything with a lint warning."
    }
  }
}
```

**Add your own agents** alongside the team:

```jsonc
{
  "agent": {
    "devops": {
      "mode": "subagent",
      "description": "Handles CI/CD, Docker, and deployment tasks.",
      "prompt": "You are the DevOps engineer..."
    }
  }
}
```

**Disable one:** `"researcher": { "disable": true }`.

**Board retention** via the tuple form: `["@te-river/opencode-team-mode@latest", { "ttlDays": 7 }]` (valid range (0, 365], invalid values fall back to 5).

## ❓ FAQ

**Will this eat my tokens?**
The opposite is the point. Offload + 80-token previews + PTC batch programs
exist because a five-agent pipeline naively bolted onto one context window
*would* eat your tokens. The governance is the token-saver.

**Is the web access safe?**
It's the most guarded surface in the plugin: two full web roles plus a
browser-only tester grant, a domain
allowlist with dialog-gated escapes (you approve any out-of-allowlist
target in OpenCode's official dialog, with a toast notification), redirects
re-checked per hop, network-layer enforcement in the browser, env-file URL
refusal, and every payload rides the same offload governance. No allowlisted
page can bounce the fetch off-site.

**Why doesn't the plugin auto-update?**
OpenCode caches plugins by spec string and never re-resolves `@latest`
(upstream limitation, not ours). **Re-run the installer — that IS the
update** (it purges the cache and re-resolves npm copies); or delete the
cache dir by hand. Recipe above and in the
[installation guide](./docs/installation.md).

**Can agents run tools in parallel?**
Yes — and they're *engineered* for it: parallel `tm_search` / `tm_webfetch` /
`tm_fetch` calls get distinct step ids and isolated payloads. A regression
here fails the test suite before it ever reaches you.

**Does it work in the CLI (TUI), or only Desktop?**
Both. Desktop adds the color-coded picker and panels; the governed tools and
the whole workflow are host-agnostic. On display-less Linux, `tm_browser`
runs headless automatically.

**What happens if I don't answer a confirmation dialog?**
It auto-rejects after `TM_ASK_TIMEOUT_MIN` (default 1). The plugin never
self-approves — the only side it can take is yours or nobody's.

## 🗑️ Uninstall

1. Remove the entry from the `"plugin"` array in your config file.
2. Delete the cache dir (table in [Install](#-read-this-once-save-yourself-an-hour-later)) if you want the disk space back.
3. Restart OpenCode. The agents, commands and tools are gone; the stores under `<repo>/.git/opencode-team/` (and `~/.opencode-team/` for global memories) are plain files you can delete whenever.

No DLLs were harmed. Nothing was written to your working tree.

## 🏛️ Architecture (for the curious)

```
opencode-team-mode/
├── src/

│   ├── approval-gate.ts  ← Unified approval gate (dialog timeout auto-reject)

│   │                        webfetch / search / memory / browser / shell-bridge / ptc/ (9 modules)
│   └── types.ts          ← Loader-contract types (1.18.x)

└── README.*.md           ← You are here (twice)
```

The loader calls `server(input, options)` once: the `config` hook injects the
six agents and six commands, the same call installs the R6
`tool.execute.before` guard, arms the approval gate through an `event` hook,
and registers the `tm_*` tools. User-defined agents with the same name always
win — the plugin never clobbers.

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Especially wanted: localization of agent prompts,
more agent roles, more command templates, and real-world reports of the
search engines' behavior (they rearrange their markup; the extractor filters
are intentionally loose but not psychic).
