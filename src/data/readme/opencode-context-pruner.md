# opencode-context-pruner

Continuous, verbatim context pruning for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), powered by TypeSafe [Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/).

Adapted from [fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction) (MIT). Upstream targets Claude Code's `session.compact` hook. This port prunes the **outgoing model request** from OpenCode's session hooks instead: stale tool calls/results are judged per call (keep / truncate / drop) and removed from the request view. Compaction requests are pruned directly on the `compaction` hook (`2.0.x`); on older runtimes without it (tested `0.0.0-beta-19271`) the same request arrives on the `context` hook and is recognized by its synthetic prompt signature. Persisted history is never modified, so nothing disappears from your session log.

By default it prunes only **compaction requests** (`mode: "compaction-only"`): the summary input is the largest single request in a session, and pruning it does not invalidate a prompt cache that would otherwise be reused. Set `mode: "per-request"` to also prune normal requests, but only after `gapSeconds` (default 3600) of silence — a warm prompt cache is never invalidated, and a cold one is a free moment to prune.

## Why

Long coding sessions fill up with stale tool output. Instead of an LLM-written summary that paraphrases details away, every kept message stays **verbatim** — only old tool calls/results are dropped or truncated, decided by calibrated Jev judgments.

## How it works

1. `session.hook("compaction")` and `session.hook("context")` run right before each model dispatch. Compaction (summarization) requests are pruned on the `compaction` hook; normal requests are pruned on the `context` hook, which in the default `compaction-only` mode returns immediately. On runtimes without a `compaction` hook the compaction request is recognized on the `context` hook by the synthetic, id-less compaction prompt (`You MUST summarize the conversation above…` / `Update the existing checkpoint…`)
2. messages are converted to the vendor core's shape; each tool call gets two `noul` questions: keep the call? keep the result?
3. decisions are applied to the request's message view:
   - `drop_call` removes the call and its result
   - `drop_result` keeps the call and truncates the result text with a note
   - `keep` is left untouched
4. decisions are cached per `tool_use_id` inside the session, so each tool call is judged once — requests without new tool calls make **no Jev request at all**
5. fail-open: any error leaves the request untouched

Tool call/result pairing is always preserved (a dropped call takes its result with it).

## Measured (2026-09-19, a real 530-message session)

```
messages: 530
judged:   257 calls (7 batches, fitted state 24,974 tokens)
dropped:  257 calls + 257 results, removedMessages: 282
time:     1,135 ms
result:   model replied normally
```

## Measured (2026-09-24, `compaction` hook on `2.0.15`)

A manual compaction fired `session.hook("compaction")` and the request view was rewritten from the hook (decision log: `hook: "compaction"`, `compaction: true`, `changedMessages: 3`, `applied: true`). The runtime builds the provider request from the event object the hooks return — `SessionModelRequest.prepare` reads `system` / `messages` / `tools` back off it — so a replaced `event.messages` is what gets sent.

## Requirements

- OpenCode V2 beta **`0.0.0-beta-19271` or newer**; compaction requests are pruned directly on `2.0.x` (older runtimes fall back to `context`-hook signature detection)
- TypeSafe API key: `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` in the environment of the OpenCode server, or `~/.config/opencode/typesafe/api_key`

## Install

```sh
opencode plugin add opencode-context-pruner
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=...
```

Or run from a local checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hoshinodis/opencode-context-pruner ~/app/opencode-context-pruner
ln -s ~/app/opencode-context-pruner ~/.config/opencode/plugins/opencode-context-pruner
```

## Options

Plugin options can be passed through OpenCode's plugin config; defaults below.

| option | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | `TYPESAFE_COMPACTION=off` also disables |
| `mode` | `compaction-only` | `compaction-only` prunes only compaction requests; `per-request` also prunes normal requests after `gapSeconds` of silence (`TYPESAFE_PRUNER_MODE=per-request` also switches) |
| `gapSeconds` | `3600` | in `per-request` mode, how long the session must be idle before a normal request is pruned; `0` prunes every request |
| `model` | `jev-1.13.0` | pinned Jev model |
| `keepThreshold` | `0.15` | `noul` threshold for keeping a call/result (upstream uses `0.5`; see below) |
| `preserveRecentMessages` | `10` | newest messages are never judged |
| `truncateHeadChars` | `300` | head kept when truncating a result |
| `minResultChars` | `4000` | skip entirely when the request has less tool output |
| `maxStateTokens` / `maxRequestTokens` | `25000` / `30000` | state fitting limits |
| `rejudge` | `never` | `always` re-judges everything on each request |
| `apiKeyEnv` / `apiKeyFile` | `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` / `~/.config/opencode/typesafe/api_key` | key lookup |
| `logFile` | `~/.config/opencode/context-pruner/decisions.jsonl` | JSONL decision log |

### Why `compaction-only` is the default

Pruning a normal request rewrites part of the message prefix, which invalidates the provider's prompt (KV) cache from the mutation point on: the suffix is re-read at full price, while the removed tokens would only have saved the cached-read price. The compaction request is different — after a compaction the checkpoint replaces the whole prefix, so no cache is reused afterwards, and its input is the biggest single request in a session (we have measured 565-message compaction requests). Pruning there cuts the most expensive request without paying for extra cache, and a leaner input tends to produce a leaner checkpoint, which every later request pays for. If your provider does not cache prompts, `mode: "per-request"` is a pure win instead.

In `per-request` mode the plugin therefore only touches a normal request when the session has been idle for `gapSeconds` (default one hour): a warm cache is left alone, and after a longer break the cache is dead anyway, so the accumulated stale tool output can be pruned for free. `gapSeconds: 0` restores the original every-request behavior.

### Why `keepThreshold` defaults to 0.15, not 0.5

The two questions Jev answers are "is this call still needed for the assistant's next action?" and "is the full result still needed?". Measured on a realistic transcript, old calls score:

```
keepCall   0.17 – 0.23
keepResult 0.11 – 0.14
```

With upstream's `0.5` (or even `0.3`) every unpinned call is `drop_call`. With `0.15` the common outcome becomes `drop_result`: the call and its input stay, only the bulky result text is truncated. Set `keepThreshold: 0.5` if you want the original aggressive behavior.

## Non-destructive by construction

Decisions are applied to **clones**: input messages and tool parts are never mutated (this is enforced by tests). Only the request view is replaced; persisted history and the UI keep every original message. If the runtime rejects the replacement array, the plugin does nothing (fail-open).

## Caveats

- In `compaction-only` mode the plugin does nothing until a compaction happens; the context grows until the runtime compacts (auto or manual). That is the point — it keeps the prompt cache intact — but it also means the context-reduction effect is deferred.
- Decisions are cached per `tool_use_id`: a call judged once keeps that verdict for the rest of the session.
- `keepThreshold: 0.5` (upstream's default) drops nearly every unpinned call in a long session; the `0.15` default exists to keep the call and truncate only its result.
- Jev can be wrong. The decision log keeps every action so you can audit and re-tune.
