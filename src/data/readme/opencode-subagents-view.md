# opencode-subagents-view
A terminal UI plugin for OpenCode that adds a live "Subagents" panel to the session sidebar, showing a colored status icon and label for each tracked child session. Unofficial community project, not affiliated with the OpenCode team.

## Installation

### From npm

1. Open the command palette (`ctrl+p`) inside opencode and select **Install plugin**. Type `opencode-subagents-view` as the package name, choose local or global scope (global makes it available in every project), and confirm.

   This installs the package and writes the matching entry into `tui.json` for you (global `~/.config/opencode/tui.json`, or a project-level `tui.json` if you chose local scope). It also loads the plugin in the current session immediately, no restart needed. This is the way this plugin is actually tested and verified working, starting from a completely clean state.

   If you'd rather edit `tui.json` yourself instead (for example to review the exact change first), the equivalent manual entry is:

   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
     "plugin": ["opencode-subagents-view"]
   }
   ```

   This plugin only exports a `tui` entrypoint, and opencode resolves TUI-kind plugins through a separate config file dedicated to TUI settings, independent from the main `opencode.json`. If you go this route instead of the command palette, quit and restart opencode afterward, since config and plugins are only read at startup.

2. Confirm it actually loaded (not just that config accepted it) by opening the command palette (`ctrl+p`) and selecting **Plugins**. Look for `subagents-view` under "External" with a green **active** status.

   Note: `opencode debug info` is **not** a reliable check for this. It only echoes what the config declares, not whether the plugin actually resolved and loaded at runtime, so it can report success even when nothing actually loaded.

### From source (for development)

1. Clone this repo somewhere on your machine, e.g.:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:giovannic96/opencode-subagents-view.git ~/repos/personal/opencode-subagents-view
   ```

2. Install its dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ~/repos/personal/opencode-subagents-view
   npm install
   ```

3. Register it in `tui.json`/`tui.jsonc` using the absolute path to this folder instead of the package name:

   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
     "plugin": ["/absolute/path/to/opencode-subagents-view"]
   }
   ```

   Two things worth knowing, both learned the hard way while building this:
   - Dropping this folder into `.opencode/plugins/` (or `~/.config/opencode/plugins/`) will **not** work on its own, since opencode's auto-discovery for that folder only picks up bare `.ts`/`.js` files, not a package-shaped directory like this one.
   - Putting the `plugin` entry in `opencode.json` instead of `tui.json` also will not work: that only affects server-side plugin loading. TUI-kind plugins (like this one) are resolved by a separate config pipeline that reads `tui.json`/`tui.jsonc` specifically.

4. Quit and restart opencode, then confirm it loaded the same way as in the npm instructions above.

## How it works

This is a plain TUI plugin, not a fork or patch of opencode itself. It hooks into the same `sidebar_content` slot that the built-in Context, LSP, MCP, and Todo sections use, so it renders as just another section in the existing sidebar rather than a separate window or overlay.

> **Status**: being built incrementally, one small, tested, verified-in-a-real-session step at a time. Currently implemented and verified:
> - A "Subagents (N active)" section appears only after the current session spawns its first direct child session (e.g. one spawned via the `task` tool).
> - After that, it stays visible until the session is disposed, even if all tracked children go idle.
> - The section renders one row per tracked child, showing a colored status icon, a label that truncates to fit the sidebar, and a second indented line with the current live activity when available. Wrapped lines align under the text on their own row (not under the icon or the arrow), using a fixed-width prefix column plus a growing text column, since the terminal renderer has no built-in hanging-indent for wrapped text.
> - The section header can be collapsed and expanded with a mouse click.
> - When a new run starts (a fresh child session appears after the section had only idle children), the old idle rows are cleared so the section shows only the new run.
>

### Code layout

- `src/child-sessions-tracker.ts`: session membership logic plus the live session subscription. Plain data in, data out.
- `src/child-sessions-types.ts`: shared child-session and event types. `CHILD_SESSION_EVENT_TYPES` is defined once here and the event type union is derived from it, so the rest of the code never repeats it.
- `src/labels-ui.ts`: all label and activity formatting helpers (`formatChildSessionLabel`, `getChildSessionDisplayLabel`, `truncateChildSessionLabel`, `getChildStatusMeta`, and the tool/activity label builders). Plain data in, data out, no solid-js.
- `src/tui.tsx`: the package's real `./tui` entrypoint. Contains no plugin logic of its own. Synchronously patches solid-js's exports (see [Why this plugin patches solid-js's exports at runtime](#why-this-plugin-patches-solid-jss-exports-at-runtime)), then dynamically imports `src/plugin.tsx` for the actual implementation, from a location outside `node_modules` if needed (see [Why this plugin escapes node_modules to load its own JSX](#why-this-plugin-escapes-node_modules-to-load-its-own-jsx)).
- `src/plugin.tsx`: the actual plugin implementation, and the only file that touches solid-js (`createSignal`) and JSX, kept as thin as possible on purpose (see "Why all the solid-js code lives in one file" below). Registers the section at `order: 350` in the shared `sidebar_content` slot (built-ins: Context=100, MCP=200, LSP=300, Todo=400, Files=500), placing it right after LSP, before Todo. Also owns the collapse/expand signal for the section header. Starts with a `@jsxImportSource @opentui/solid` pragma (see [Why this plugin escapes node_modules to load its own JSX](#why-this-plugin-escapes-node_modules-to-load-its-own-jsx)).

### Why all the solid-js code lives in one file

Earlier in the project, `createSignal`/`createEffect` was split across files and ended up with different `solid-js` instances, so updates stopped propagating. The fix was to keep all Solid usage in `src/plugin.tsx`. Plain TypeScript modules can stay separate.

### Development

- `npm test` (or `bun test --conditions=browser`) runs the test suite. Session-tracking rules and the plugin's reactive wiring are tested together in `tests/child-sessions-tracker.test.ts` using plain mocks and solid-js's `createRoot`, without needing a real opencode instance. The `--conditions=browser` flag exists because `bun test` eagerly discovers this project's entire module graph upfront, including files reached only through a dynamic `import()`, which defeats the runtime patch described below for the test suite specifically. This does not affect real usage: opencode discovers this plugin only through a runtime string path read from `tui.json`, which it can't pre-scan the same way, verified directly against a real opencode instance starting from a genuinely unpatched `solid-js`.
- `npm run typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`.

### A real bug this project hit, and how it's guarded against now

An early version of the section re-created state on every render and could trigger a feedback loop. The fix caches state per session id for the plugin lifetime, so later renders reuse the settled state instead of starting over. `tests/tui.test.ts` pins that down.

The current implementation keeps a record for each child session. Active children count toward the sidebar number, idle children stay visible, and deleted children are removed entirely. The section itself stays visible once the first child has appeared, until the session is disposed.

One subtle but important detail: the cache does **not** store the count itself. It stores the function returned by `getOrCreateChildSessionCount`, and that function closes over a Solid signal. The signal changes when `setChildIds(...)` runs, but the cached function stays the same, so every later call to `childSessionCount()` still reads the latest number. That is why caching the function is enough, even though the cache entry itself is only written once.

The full flow is:

1. `View(...)` renders for a specific `session_id`.
2. `getOrCreateChildSessionCount(...)` checks whether that session already has a cached getter.
3. On the first render for that session, it creates a Solid signal with an empty `Set` of child ids.
4. `trackChildSessions(...)` subscribes to live `session.created`, `session.updated`, `session.status`, `session.idle`, `session.deleted`, `session.next.step.ended`, `session.next.step.failed`, `session.next.tool.input.started`, `session.next.tool.called`, `session.next.retried`, and `message.part.updated` events.
5. The live events are handled a little differently:
   - `session.created`: a new direct child session was created. If it belongs to the current parent, it is added as `active` and gets the base label like `[agent] title`.
   - `session.updated`: an existing session changed. If it still belongs to the current parent and is already tracked, it stays in whatever state it already had; if it no longer belongs, it is removed.
   - `session.status`: the session reported a status change. `busy` keeps the child active, `idle` marks it idle, and `retry` marks it retry.
   - `session.idle`: the session explicitly went idle. The child stays in the map but becomes `idle`.
    - `session.next.step.ended`: the child finished its current step. The row stays visible, but the status becomes `idle`.
    - `session.next.step.failed`: the child failed its current step. The row stays visible, but the status becomes `error`.
    - `session.next.tool.input.started`: the child started preparing a tool call. The row only changes if the tool input already contains a target we can show.
    - `session.next.tool.called`: the tool was called. The row activity becomes a concrete summary like `searching src/**/*.ts`, `editing README.md`, or `running shell: bun test` when the input provides a target. If OpenCode does not give us a target, the existing activity stays in place.
    - `session.next.retried`: the session retried. The row activity becomes `retrying N`.
    - `message.part.updated`: a finalized part arrived or changed. The row activity is derived from the part type, for example a raw text snippet for `text`, `glob: src/**/*.ts` for completed tool output, or `subtask: ...` for delegated work.
    - `session.deleted`: the child session was deleted. If its id is tracked, it is removed from the map.
    - Those event names are defined once in `src/child-sessions-types.ts` and the type is derived from that list, so the code does not repeat the union in multiple places.
6. Whenever one of those cases changes the set, `setChildIds(...)` replaces the signal with a new set.
7. Solid notices that `childIds()` changed, so `childSessionCount()` is re-evaluated.
8. The sidebar now shows the updated `Subagents (N active)` value, plus a per-row status icon, the original `[agent] title`, and a second indented line for the current activity when available. If all tracked children are idle, the section stays visible as `Subagents (0 active)` until a new child arrives, at which point old idle rows are cleared and the new run starts fresh.
9. If the same session is rendered again, the cached getter is reused instead of creating a new signal or a new listener.
10. When the plugin/view is being shut down, for example when you quit opencode, close the terminal, or disable/reload the plugin, the `onDispose(...)` callback runs. It calls `unsubscribe()` so the live event listeners stop and the cached entry for that session is removed.
11. That cleanup matters because otherwise the plugin would keep listening to old session events even after the view is gone.

### Real Example

Suppose the current session is `A`.

- At first, there are no live child-session events yet, so the sidebar stays hidden.
- Later, opencode creates a new session `B` with `parentID: "A"`.
- A `session.created` event arrives.
- `updateChildSessionMembership(...)` sees that `B` belongs to `A`, so it adds `B` to the set.
- The count changes from `0` to `1`, and the sidebar shows `Subagents (1 active)`.
- If `B` later becomes idle, the `session.idle` or `session.status` event keeps it in the record map but marks it `idle`, and the section stays visible.
- If every tracked child is idle, the section stays visible as `Subagents (0 active)`.
- When a new child appears after that idle-only state, the old idle rows are cleared so the section shows only the new run.
- If `B` starts text, the second line stays as-is unless OpenCode later gives concrete text to show.
- If `B` calls a tool, the second line shows a concrete summary like `searching src/**/*.ts` or `running shell: bun test` when the tool input has a target, and it stays unchanged when the tool has no target or fails.
- If `B` emits a finalized part, `message.part.updated` refreshes the second line with that concrete summary only when there is real text to show.
- If `B` finishes a step, the `session.next.step.ended` or `session.next.step.failed` event marks it `idle` or `error`, and the section stays visible.
- If OpenCode emits a later `session.updated` for `B`, the plugin keeps it idle instead of reactivating it.
- If `B` is deleted, the `session.deleted` event removes it from the map.
- The count goes back to `0`, but the sidebar stays visible until the session itself is disposed.

### Why this plugin patches solid-js's exports at runtime

`solid-js` publishes a conditional `exports` map with a `"node"` condition that points at its server-side rendering build, a one-shot, non-reactive implementation meant for frameworks that render HTML once on a Node.js backend. Bun explicitly supports and matches that `"node"` condition for compatibility with the wider Node ecosystem.

That's the right choice for a typical Node.js backend, but wrong here: this plugin runs inside an interactive terminal UI, not a one-shot server render, and needs the same reactive build (the one `solid-js`'s `"browser"`/default condition points to) that `@opentui/solid` itself expects. Because opencode dynamically imports this plugin's own unbundled `node_modules` at runtime (rather than bundling it ahead of time the way opencode's own internal UI code is built), Bun's normal condition matching kicks in and picks the wrong one, not just for this plugin's own code, but also for `@opentui/solid`'s own internal `solid-js` imports, since its Bun-specific build also imports `solid-js` as a bare specifier.

The symptom, if this isn't patched, is subtle and confusing: `createSignal`, `createEffect`, and `createMemo` all still exist and don't throw, but nothing created with them ever updates after the initial render, because the resolved `solid-js` build's `createEffect` is a literal no-op and its signals don't notify subscribers.

This plugin does **not** bundle `solid-js` or `@opentui/solid` into a single prebuilt file. An earlier version tried that, and while it initially seemed to break the sidebar entirely, a corrected version of that same bundling approach (using `bun build --target=bun --conditions=browser`, so `@opentui/solid`'s actual Bun-specific build gets selected and inlined rather than a generic fallback) was verified live against a real opencode instance and *did* register successfully. It still did not render the actual "Subagents" section, though, so it was set aside in favor of the fix described below regardless of the initial registration success.

This plugin also does **not** use a `postinstall` script, even though that's the more common way to patch a dependency (for example with [`patch-package`](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package)). Both approaches were tried and both failed for the same underlying reason: opencode's own **"Install Plugin"** command, the way a first-time user actually installs this plugin from npm without cloning any source, installs the package **without running lifecycle scripts**. A `postinstall` step verified working when installing from source (a real `npm install` invocation) silently never runs when opencode installs the plugin itself, leaving `solid-js` unpatched and the sidebar broken for exactly the users this package is published for.

The fix instead lives in the plugin's own module graph. `src/tui.tsx`, the package's real `./tui` entrypoint, contains no plugin logic of its own. It synchronously locates and patches `solid-js`'s `package.json` (removing the `"node"` condition, resolving the correct copy via `require.resolve("solid-js", { paths: [here] })` relative to its own file location, which always finds the right copy regardless of how this plugin was installed or how deeply it ends up nested), and only *then* dynamically imports the actual implementation (see [Why this plugin escapes node_modules to load its own JSX](#why-this-plugin-escapes-node_modules-to-load-its-own-jsx) for what that import actually resolves to), which is the file that statically imports `solid-js` and `@opentui/solid`. Because dynamic `import()` calls in a real runtime module graph (unlike `bun test`'s own eager whole-project scanning) only get resolved at the point they're actually reached, that file's own `solid-js` import, and `@opentui/solid`'s internal one, both resolve *after* the patch has already been applied.

This guarantees the patch runs every single time this plugin loads, through any installation path, with no separate install-time step required at all. It was verified end to end starting from a genuinely fresh, unpatched `solid-js` (confirmed via its `package.json` before each run), loaded directly by a real opencode instance, spawning a real subagent, and observing the "Subagents" section render correctly with live activity.

### Why this plugin escapes node_modules to load its own JSX

`src/plugin.tsx` uses JSX, and its type of JSX (`@opentui/solid`'s, not React's) is only chosen correctly if the host transpiling it knows to use `jsxImportSource: "@opentui/solid"`. This project's own `tsconfig.json` configures that, and a per-file `@jsxImportSource @opentui/solid` pragma comment at the top of `src/plugin.tsx` does the same thing directly in the source, read by whatever transpiles the file rather than looked up externally.

Neither one is enough for how this plugin is actually installed by a real npm user, whether through a plain `npm install` into some project or through opencode's own **"Install Plugin"** command: either way, this plugin's files end up inside a `node_modules` folder, and Bun applies a different default for any file resolved from a path containing a `node_modules` segment, ignoring both the project's `tsconfig.json` and the per-file pragma comment, falling back to assuming React's JSX runtime instead. This was verified directly: the exact same files, with the exact same pragma, render correctly when placed at a path with no `node_modules` segment in it, and fail to render (without erroring) when placed at a path that has one, even when the only difference between the two is the path itself. Shipping `tsconfig.json` in the published package was tried and confirmed not to help for the same reason. Prebuilding the JSX away entirely ahead of time (transpiling `src/plugin.tsx`'s JSX into explicit calls at publish time, still without bundling `solid-js` or `@opentui/solid` themselves) was also tried, and while it fixed the resolution problem on its own, it broke rendering the same way an earlier attempt at bundling `solid-js` and `@opentui/solid` together did: the plugin registered and imported correctly, but the "Subagents" section still didn't render, verified live against a real opencode instance, and with both the "dev" and "production" JSX runtime variants. Both were set aside.

The fix that works is for `src/tui.tsx` to notice, at load time, whether its own package root sits inside a `node_modules` folder, and if so, copy `src/plugin.tsx` and its sibling implementation files to a stable location outside `node_modules` (under the OS temp directory, namespaced by this package's own version), with `node_modules` symlinked back to this package's own dependencies so the copy still resolves `solid-js` and `@opentui/solid` normally, and dynamically import the implementation from that copied location instead of its original one. When the package root is already outside `node_modules`, which is the case for the "from source" development flow, this copying step is skipped entirely and the implementation is imported directly.

This was verified with the same rigor as the solid-js fix above: a real npm tarball, installed with `--ignore-scripts` into a fresh nested project (mirroring exactly how opencode's own installer behaves), and a real opencode instance loaded from that exact nested `node_modules` installation, spawning a real subagent and rendering the "Subagents" section correctly with live activity, starting from a completely clean state with no prior installation of this plugin at all.
