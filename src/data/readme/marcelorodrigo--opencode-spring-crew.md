## 🔁 The Pipeline

**Spring Crew** works best as a pipeline.

You start with a rough idea and end with reviewed, production-ready code: each agent handing off to the next like a relay race, each one knowing exactly what to expect from the previous and what to produce for the next.

### Two ways to work: Manual or Automated

**Option 1: Orchestrator (Automated Pipeline)**

Use the **Orchestrator** agent to manage the full pipeline automatically:

```bash
# Start the orchestrator
/agent spring-crew:orchestrator

# Provide your task
Task: JIRA-123: Add user authentication with JWT tokens
```

The Orchestrator will:
- ✅ Manage the full pipeline from Rubber Duck → Architect → Implementer → Code Reviewer
- ✅ Validate artifacts between each step
- ✅ Request approval at each stage (human-in-the-loop mode)
- ✅ Or run autonomously without approval gates (autonomous mode)
- ✅ Generate a complete execution report with all artifacts

**Two execution modes:**

1. **Human-in-the-Loop (default):** Pauses after each agent for approval
   ```
   Task: Add user authentication
   ```

2. **Autonomous:** Runs full pipeline without interruption
   ```
   Mode: autonomous
   Task: Add logging to PaymentService
   ```

**Option 2: Manual Agent Switching**

You don't switch context. You switch agents.

1. Start a conversation with the _Rubber Duck_: describe your idea, even half-baked or a rough draft is fine. The Rubber Duck will ask sharp questions, challenge your assumptions, and widen your thinking before you commit to anything. When the thinking is done, it produces a **Brainstorm Brief** right there in the conversation. Take that output, open a new session with the Architect, and paste it in.

2. The _Architect_ reads the brief, explores your codebase, makes every binding technical decision: class names, package paths, API contracts, error handling, and produces an **Architecture Spec**. Take that spec to the Implementer.

3. The _Implementer_ reads the spec, matches your codebase's conventions, writes production code with tests, runs the build, and produces an **Implementation Summary** with everything the reviewer needs to know. Take that to the Code Reviewer.

4. The _Code Reviewer_ diffs against `master`, validates the implementation against the spec and Clean Architecture principles, and delivers a categorized review. Nothing ships past it without earning it.

**You can also enter at any stage.**
- Already know the direction? Skip the Rubber Duck and start with the Architect.
- Already have a spec? Hand it straight to the Implementer.
- Want an expert eye on existing code? Point the Code Reviewer at a branch.
- Use the Orchestrator to automate the full pipeline.

The pipeline is the recommended path, but each agent stands on its own.

## 🧠 Meet the Crew

### Orchestrator: The Pipeline Manager

_It was born from the need to coordinate. In the chaos of context-switching between agents, the Orchestrator emerged—a workflow manager that understands one truth: great software comes from specialists doing what they do best, in the right order, at the right time. It doesn't write code. It doesn't design systems. It doesn't review. It coordinates. It validates. It enforces the handoff protocol. It ensures nothing ships without passing through every gate._

**Role:** `Workflow coordination · Pipeline management · Artifact validation · Approval gates`

**Invoke when:**
- You want to execute the full 4-agent pipeline from a Jira ticket or feature request
- You need structured handoffs with validation between each phase
- You want human approval gates at each step (human-in-the-loop mode)
- You want fully automated execution without interruption (autonomous mode)
- You need a complete audit trail of the development workflow

**Two execution modes:**

1. **Human-in-the-Loop (default):**
   - Pauses after Rubber Duck, Architect, and Implementer for approval
   - You can approve, reject, or request modifications
   - Complete control over each phase
   - Best for: critical features, learning, quality assurance

2. **Autonomous:**
   - Executes all 4 agents sequentially without pausing
   - Validates artifacts automatically
   - Aborts on validation failure after 3 retries
   - Best for: routine tasks, batch processing, rapid prototyping

**What it does:**
- ✅ Routes tasks to the appropriate specialist
- ✅ Validates artifact structure between phases
- ✅ Manages approval gates (HITL mode)
- ✅ Tracks complete workflow state
- ✅ Generates comprehensive execution reports

**What it does NOT do:**
- ❌ Write code or provide code snippets
- ❌ Design architecture or make technical decisions
- ❌ Brainstorm solutions or answer technical questions
- ❌ Review code or identify bugs
- ❌ Modify files or run commands

**Produces:** A comprehensive **Workflow Execution Report** with execution timeline, all artifacts (Brainstorm Brief, Architecture Spec, Implementation Summary, Code Review), approval history, and next steps.

### Rubber Duck: The Sparring Partner

_It was born in the silence before the first commit, in the moment when every developer stares at the screen and asks: "Is this actually the right problem?" The Rubber Duck has sat beside a thousand architects at that moment. It asks the questions nobody else will. It has no ego, no agenda — only the relentless drive to make sure the right thing gets built, for the right reason, before a single line of code is written._

**Role:** `Brainstorming · Assumption-challenging · Solution-space widening`

**Invoke when:**
- You have a vague idea and need to think it through
- You want to challenge your own assumptions before committing to an approach
- You need to explore trade-offs between multiple valid solutions
- You are about to start something new and want to stress-test the idea first

**Produces:** A structured **Brainstorm Brief** with problem statement, explored options, recommendation, and open questions for the Architect.


---

### Architect: The Blueprint Master

_The Architect has seen every pattern that ever emerged from a Spring Boot codebase — the elegant ones and the ones that haunt teams for years. It does not offer menus of architectural styles or ask what you prefer. It applies Clean Architecture because it works. It names every class, places every file, and defines every boundary before the Implementer writes the first line. Vagueness is its enemy. Precision is its craft._

**Role:** `Architecture design · Package structure · API contracts · Error handling strategy`

**Invoke when:**
- After a Rubber Duck brainstorming session has produced a Brainstorm Brief
- When you need to formalize a feature or component design before coding
- When you want exact class names, package paths, and API contracts decided upfront

**Produces:** A precise, buildable **Architecture Spec** with component design, package structure, data flow, error handling, and test strategy.

**Architectural principles enforced:**
- Clean Architecture (Controller → UseCase → Gateway → External)
- UseCase pattern: one class, one business operation
- Gateway abstraction: external systems are infrastructure details
- Constructor injection: no field injection, ever
- Domain exceptions: no generic exceptions, ever

---

### Implementer: The Builder

_The Implementer is what happens when discipline becomes instinct. It has read the spec. It has explored the codebase. It knows how the existing team writes code — the Lombok annotations, the test naming conventions, the assertion libraries. It does not add features that weren't asked for. It does not cut corners on tests. It writes code that looks like it was written by the same human who wrote the rest of the project. Then it runs the build, and it does not stop until it passes._

**Role:** `Production code · Tests · Build verification · Convention matching`

**Invoke when:**
- After the Architect has produced an Architecture Spec
- When you need to implement a feature, component, or fix based on a clear design

**Produces:** Working, tested, buildable code + an **Implementation Summary** with created/modified files, build status, and notes for the Code Reviewer.

---

### Code Reviewer: The Last Gate

_Nothing ships past the Code Reviewer without earning it. It diffs against master first — always. It validates against the Architecture Spec, Clean Architecture principles, and Spring Boot best practices. It is not here to comment on formatting. It is here to find the bugs, the missed edge cases, the architectural violations, the tests that don't actually test anything. It is also the first to acknowledge clean, well-built code. It has seen enough bad code to recognize — and respect — the good._

**Role:** `Architecture compliance · Bug detection · Security · Test quality · Read-only`

**Invoke when:**
- After the Implementer has completed an implementation
- When you want to validate code changes before merging
- When you want a critical review of existing code against best practices

**Review categories:**
- 🔴 **Critical**: Must fix before merge. Bugs, security issues, architectural violations.
- 🟡 **Important**: Should fix. Deviations from spec, missing tests, incorrect patterns.
- 🟢 **Suggestion**: Nice to have. Non-blocking improvements.

**Produces:** A **Code Review** report with findings categorized by severity, a "What's Done Well" section, and a final verdict: ✅ Approve · ⚠️ Approve with comments · 🔴 Request changes.
