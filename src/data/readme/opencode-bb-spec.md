## 🚀 30-second start

```bash
/plugin marketplace add 0xBB2B/bb-spec
/plugin install bb-spec-core@0xbb2b
/plugin install bb-spec-workflow@0xbb2b
```

The 5 mainline commands:

| Command | What it does | When |
|---|---|---|
| `/spec` | Break a requirement into one-rule-per-file specs | New requirement |
| `/plan` | spec → function-level implementation plan | Spec is ready |
| `/exec` | Three-agent isolated Test→Impl→Review | Plan is ready |
| `/review` | Parallel finders + adversarial verify | Before opening PR |
| `/git-push` | pre-review self-check + push + open PR | Ready to ship |

Three branches, callable anytime: `/git-clone` (pull a remote project locally + write `.bb-spec.yaml`, one-shot onboarding), `/revise` (route any deviation back to the right stage by root cause), `/doc-update` (whole-repo spec / doc / code consistency sweep).

Optional upstream: `/prd` (PM / requester brainstorms a PRD; shipped separately as bb-spec-product).

---

## 🔁 The `spec → ship` pipeline

```
 (opt) /git-clone ──► clone remote + write .bb-spec.yaml
   │
 (opt) /prd ──► PRD doc
   │
 /spec ──► /plan ──► /exec ──► /review ──► /git-push
  what       how      Red→Green→Review  finders+adv  pre-review+open PR
                                                          │
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        │
        ▼ /revise (anytime, routed by root cause)
          spec-defect → /spec   ·   impl-drift → /exec   ·   review finding → targeted fix

 (opt) /test-webview · /test-api — frontend / backend e2e between /exec and /review
 /doc-update (periodic / on-demand) — sweep whole repo → default updates spec/doc;
                                        obviously bad code stops to ask → routes to /revise
```

**Why this pipeline is reliable** — every handoff is a *file on disk*, not a memory in the chat. That's what makes it resumable, AI-swappable, and auditable end to end.

### 🎯 Stages at a glance

- **`/git-clone`** — *One-shot onboarding*: pull a remote repo locally and write `.bb-spec.yaml`.
  - **Two AskUserQuestion prompts**: ① single-repo vs multi-repo workspace (decides directory layout) ② `base_dir` (decides where every later bb-spec artifact lands)
  - **Multi-repo workspace**: creates a shared parent dir and clones each member repo into it (restoring the relative layout the build tool expects); refuses to nest or overwrite
  - Tightly scoped: **only** pulls code + writes `base_dir` — does not read code or install deps

- **`/spec`** — Requirement breakdown through dialogue. Answers **"what to build."**
  - One rule per file, ≤100 lines, one thing + one example, non-overlapping
  - Lightweight `INDEX.md` up front — readers scan the index before loading specifics

- **`/plan`** — spec → self-contained, **function-level** plan. Answers **"how to build it."**
  - One independent problem per file, down to function names and responsibilities; declarative artifacts (DDL / API contracts / config) are **inlined in final form** for exec to write verbatim
  - Invocation enters **plan mode for read-only alignment** — nothing lands until you approve; **new third-party dependencies are listed as a dedicated section**, and approval counts as the explicit user consent version-policy requires

- **`/exec`** — **Three-agent isolated execution**, the core anti-cheat design.
  - *Test* agent reads spec rules only, writes failing tests (Red)
  - *Impl* agent **never sees the spec**, only the tests + function list, so it can't quietly "teach to intent"; new third-party libs capped by the plan's approved list
  - *Review* agent checks against the spec plus a robustness/security pass, read-only
  - Each execution group is one Workflow run: plans in the group run concurrently, each through Red→Green→Gate→Review, with retry caps and blocking decided by the script
  - Progress written to `PROGRESS.md` after every group — **token-exhausted runs resume losslessly**

- **`/test-webview`** — **Web-interaction acceptance** for frontend / web projects.
  - Brings the app up via the project's Docker stack (confirmed once, then remembered; `down -v` cleans up afterward), drives a real browser via the browser MCP
  - **Each case runs in an isolated serial subagent** — hundreds of cases never blow the main context; fully serial (shared single browser)
  - Cases auto-generated from spec / plan / PRD; **coverage alignment** before a full run, gaps never silently dropped; failures route to `/revise`
  - Requires a browser MCP (playwright / chrome-devtools)

- **`/test-api`** — **API e2e** for any backend.
  - `compose.e2e.yaml` brings the stack up; md cases **mechanically render to a single-file Bun TS runner** that runs in one shot via `bun run`
  - **Zero subagents, zero concurrency** — HTTP is deterministic, clock state is shared
  - **Time-sensitive rules** (token expiry, order timeout, points expiry) tested through `/test/advance-time`, `/test/backdate`, `/test/trigger-job`
  - App side ships **two images**: test image carries `/test/*` routes + `ENV TESTAPI=1`; production image **physically excludes** `/test/*` source; `/test/healthz` probe gates the run, no fallback

- **`/review`** — Workflow-orchestrated, **adversarially verified** local PR review.
  - Phase 1 slices the diff (≤1500 lines per slice), writes each slice's diff to disk once, and fans out **3 finders per slice in parallel**: defect (security / robustness / correctness) / design (quality / simplicity / doc-sync) / **Codex cross-model independent** review, schema-enforced
  - Phase 2 **one skeptic verifier per slice** judges every 🔴/🟡 in that slice on three lenses (importance / root-cause / risk-if-unfixed), majority vote
  - Phase 3 **one sweeper per slice** hunts sibling sites of every confirmed defect class inside that slice; each class is handed to `/revise` as one fix; NITs can be cleared in one batch
  - Every phase dispatches per slice, so cost scales at ~300 tokens per diff line (a 15k-line diff ≈ 50 agents / 5M tokens)
  - Once fixes land, the fix diff gets **one automatic re-review**; the report is persisted under `.bb-spec/.cache/review/` so the next run flags recurrences and skips already-rejected items
  - Read-only — never auto-edits; requires Claude Code ≥ 2.1.154

- **`/revise`** — The exception handler, callable anytime.
  - Classifies a deviation's **root cause** into one of three: *spec-defect* (→ `/spec`), *impl-drift* (→ `/exec`), *requirement-change*
  - Every review finding that needs fixing funnels through here

- **`/git-push`** — User-triggered push + PR flow (single or multi-repo).
  - When a spec `INDEX.md` exists, first runs a **branch-spec self-check (pre-review)**: a subagent diffs the branch vs main against the spec, fixes violations in a loop
  - Drafts a **6-section PR description** (background / requirement / approach / result / tests / spec, < 50 lines) used directly as the PR body

- **`/doc-update`** — Whole-repo spec / doc / code **consistency sweep**.
  - Six drift classes: spec-stale / doc-stale / code-violation / spec-conflict / orphan-index / uncovered-rule
  - **Code is the truth; spec / docs are mirrored to it**; only obvious hard-constraint violations stop and ask, then route to `/revise` for TDD
  - Clear boundaries against `/revise` (single point) and the `/review` `review-design` finder (doc-sync lens) (PR-diff scope)

**Ships with**

- **9 orchestration subagents** driven by the stages above: `test-engineer` / `impl-engineer` / `gate-keeper` / `spec-reviewer` / `webview-test-runner` / `review-defect` / `review-design` / `review-codex` / `pre-reviewer`
- **4 passive hooks** (automatic): block npm/yarn, block main commit, dependency version self-check, Stop four-point self-check

## 🧩 Companion constraint skills

These feed rules into the pipeline above — install only the layers you need.

### bb-spec-product — product requirements (pipeline upstream)

- **`prd`** — PM / requester brainstorms with AI: challenge first (rejection is a valid outcome) → diverge → converge, producing a self-contained PRD — goals / non-goals, prioritized user stories (every P0 carries concrete use cases and acceptance criteria), and open questions left for engineers; needs no git repo or code context, consumed directly by `/spec`

> **PMs don't need Claude Code**: every release auto-packages [`bb-spec-prd-skill.zip`](https://github.com/0xBB2B/bb-spec/releases/latest/download/bb-spec-prd-skill.zip) — download it and upload via **Settings → Customize → Skills** on claude.ai web / desktop to use the skill standalone (paid plan with code execution required); the resulting PRD is delivered to engineers as a downloadable file.

### bb-spec-core — universal discipline

- **`tdd-workflow`** — Red-Green-Refactor discipline with standard flows for the add / modify / delete scenarios
- **`version-policy`** — Standard/official libraries first — importing a new third-party library requires explicit user consent (a plan-approved dependency list counts); check a dependency's official latest version before pinning it; never trust training memory
- **`git-workflow`** — Branch decisions, incremental commits, the six-section PR description, post-merge cleanup

### bb-spec-backend — backend stack constraints

- **`golang-constraints`** — Whole-lifecycle Go: three-layer architecture, no over-abstraction, tests subordinate to production design
- **`golang-testing`** — Go test organization: table-driven, subtests, benchmark, fuzz
- **`api-design`** — REST design: resource naming, status codes, pagination, and structured `A-BBB-CCCC` error codes
- **`database-constraints`** — App-generated UUIDv7 PKs, soft delete + composite UNIQUE, DB-managed timestamps, UTC end to end
- **`auth-constraints`** — Authentication (authN): dual-token JWT + opaque refresh with rotation & replay detection, sliding expiry, argon2id
- **`authz-constraints`** — Authorization (authZ): deny-by-default, centralized decision, two-tier role + resource-ownership checks to stop IDOR
- **`observability-constraints`** — Logs / traces / metrics on OTel: one-time assembly, structured JSON with stable trace_id, bounded label cardinality
- **`service-constraints`** — Runtime governance: env-injected secrets with fail-fast, graceful lifecycle, write idempotency, timeouts + safe retries
- **`config-constraints`** — Config carrier tiers: env/secret for startup-critical non-hot-reload, yaml/configmap for hot-reloadable defaults, DB for dynamic business config; core credentials in secret/KMS only, envelope encryption when pushed down to DB

### bb-spec-frontend — frontend stack constraints

- **`vue-constraints`** — Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + bun hard stack constraints
- **`frontend-constraints`** — Conventions: one unified request client, centralized error-code → UI mapping, UX-only route guards, types from the contract

## 🧭 Platforms / Claude Code vs opencode

Both hosts ship the **same content** — 26 skills, orchestration subagents (11 on Claude Code, 10 on opencode), and 4 workflow-guard hooks (behavior-equivalent) — released in lockstep on a single version line. The differences are only in distribution and host mechanics; pick the one matching your environment (installation in the two sections below):

| Dimension | Claude Code | opencode |
|---|---|---|
| Distribution & install | 5 sub-plugins via marketplace — install only the layers you need | one npm package `opencode-bb-spec`, declared once in `opencode.json` |
| Command entry | all 26 skills invocable as `/name` slash commands, plus context auto-trigger | 11 pipeline commands (`/spec` `/exec` `/review` …); remaining skills auto-loaded by the model on demand |
| Cross-model review | review-codex dispatched through the codex plugin | Not provided — opencode can natively run GPT-family models |
| Updates | `/plugin update` | bump the npm package version |

## 📦 Claude Code Install

BB-Spec ships as **five independently installable sub-plugins** — install only the constraint layers you need.

First add the marketplace once, inside Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add 0xBB2B/bb-spec
```

Then install whichever layers you want:

| Sub-plugin | What it gives you | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **bb-spec-core** _(recommended base)_ | TDD / version-policy / git-workflow discipline + 3 passive hooks | `/plugin install bb-spec-core@0xbb2b` |
| **bb-spec-workflow** _(core)_ | spec → plan → exec → review → revise → git-push (+ opt test-webview / test-api e2e), git-clone one-shot init, init reverse-spec, doc-update whole-repo consistency sweep + 11 subagents | `/plugin install bb-spec-workflow@0xbb2b` |
| **bb-spec-product** | /prd requirement brainstorm → PRD doc with concrete use cases (for PMs / requesters) | `/plugin install bb-spec-product@0xbb2b` |
| **bb-spec-backend** | Go / REST API / DB / authN / authZ / observability / service / config constraints | `/plugin install bb-spec-backend@0xbb2b` |
| **bb-spec-frontend** | Vue 3 + TS + Vite + Tailwind + bun stack & engineering conventions (+ bun hook) | `/plugin install bb-spec-frontend@0xbb2b` |

Pick by need — e.g. just the disciplines and workflow without any stack opinions: install `bb-spec-core` + `bb-spec-workflow`. On a PM's / requester's machine: just `bb-spec-product`. Want everything: install all five.

Or add it manually to `~/.claude/settings.json` (enable only what you want):

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "0xbb2b": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "0xBB2B/bb-spec" }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "bb-spec-core@0xbb2b": true,
    "bb-spec-workflow@0xbb2b": true,
    "bb-spec-product@0xbb2b": false,
    "bb-spec-backend@0xbb2b": false,
    "bb-spec-frontend@0xbb2b": false
  }
}
```

### Install via Claude Code Desktop (with screenshots)

For the Claude Code Desktop app (Mac / Windows). Pure GUI flow — no commands required.

**1. Open the plugin manager**

Click `+` in the input box → `Plugins` → `Manage plugins`:

  <img src="./assets/desktop/01-manage-plugins.png" alt="Open plugin manager" width="100%" />
</p>

**2. Add a marketplace**

In the Plugins panel, click `Add` (top right) → `Add marketplace`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/desktop/02-add-marketplace.png" alt="Add marketplace" width="100%" />
</p>

**3. Choose "Add from a repository"**

In the dialog, pick `Add from a repository`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/desktop/03-from-repository.png" alt="Add from a repository" width="100%" />
</p>

**4. Paste the bb-spec URL and sync**

URL: `https://github.com/0xBB2B/bb-spec`, then click `Sync`:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/desktop/04-sync-url.png" alt="Sync marketplace" width="100%" />
</p>

**5. Enable the core trio**

The Directory now shows bb-spec's 5 sub-plugins. Click the gear icon on the `Bb spec core` / `Bb spec workflow` / `Bb spec product` cards to enable them (backend / frontend optional):

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/desktop/05-enable-plugins.png" alt="Enable plugins" width="100%" />
</p>

**6. Verify the install**

Back in the input box, type `/prd`. If the command suggestion shows up, you're set:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/desktop/06-verify-prd.png" alt="Verify install" width="100%" />
</p>

## 🔌 opencode Install

BB-Spec also ships as an [opencode](https://opencode.ai) plugin: one npm package delivering all 26 skills, 10 subagents, 11 commands and 4 workflow-guard hooks (full parity except the Claude Code-specific codex cross-model review — opencode can natively run GPT-family models, so no codex CLI detour is needed).

Declare it in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (global) or a project-level `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-bb-spec"]
}
```

Restart opencode, then verify with `opencode debug skill`. Details and the Claude Code ↔ opencode mapping: [opencode/README.md](opencode/README.md).

## 🔄 Versioning

```bash
/plugin update                  # check and update every installed plugin
/plugin update bb-spec-core     # update only one sub-plugin
```

The five sub-plugins share a single synchronized version line.

---

## 🪝 Hooks enabled by default

Each hook ships with the sub-plugin that owns its concern — install that plugin to get it.

| Hook | Sub-plugin | Trigger | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `block-non-bun-pm` | bb-spec-frontend | PreToolUse(Bash) | Blocks `npm` / `yarn` / `pnpm` package-manager actions, enforcing `bun`; existing projects with a matching lockfile (e.g. `package-lock.json`) are allowed through |
| `git-workflow-guard` | bb-spec-core | PreToolUse(Bash) | Blocks `git commit` on `main` / `master`; for other git flow actions (branch / push / worktree / merge / PR) allows them through and injects the git-workflow discipline plus live git status |
| `dep-version-check` | bb-spec-core | PostToolUse(Write\|Edit) | After editing a dependency file, injects a "check the official latest version first" reminder |
---

## 🧪 Tests

```bash
bash tests/validate.sh
```

Validates the multi-plugin structure: marketplace.json validity and plugin-entry consistency (every `source` resolves to a real plugin dir whose name matches), each sub-plugin's plugin.json fields, agent frontmatter integrity (required fields, name consistency, valid agent-type values, security-baseline section), skill SKILL.md format, hooks.json validity and script existence, and personal-path leak detection.

CI runs automatically on PRs and pushes to main (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

---

## 🛠️ Recommended companions

### CLAUDE.md template

The repo-root [`CLAUDE.template.md`](./CLAUDE.template.md) is a companion "iron-rule index" reference. It is **not installed automatically** — copy it to your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or a project-root `CLAUDE.md` as needed and trim to taste.

### .bb-spec.yaml project config

`/prd`, `/spec` and `/plan` output under `.bb-spec/docs/` by default (`.bb-spec/docs/prd/`, `…/spec/`, `…/plan/`); runtime transient artifacts (e.g. webview screenshots) go to the sibling `.bb-spec/.cache/` (auto-gitignored). Create a `.bb-spec.yaml` in the project root to override the bb-spec root directory:

```yaml
base_dir: my/bb  # → my/bb/docs/{prd,spec,plan,test}/ and my/bb/.cache/ ; use ./ to place them at the project root
```

Reference template: [`.bb-spec.template.yaml`](./.bb-spec.template.yaml).

---

## ⚙️ Hook switch cheat sheet

| Scenario | Switch |
|---|---|
| Temporarily allow npm / yarn / pnpm | Disable `bb-spec-frontend` temporarily |
| Temporarily allow main commit | Disable `bb-spec-core` temporarily |
| Skip the Stop self-check | No switch — this is a core iron rule, skipping is discouraged |

---

## 💡 Prior art & acknowledgements

BB-Spec stands on three excellent projects. Each shaped a different part of its design — credited below, alongside what BB-Spec borrowed and how it pushed the idea further.

| Project | What it does best | What BB-Spec borrowed & hardened |
|---|---|---|
| [**Superpowers**](https://github.com/obra/Superpowers) (obra) — a complete coding-agent methodology | End-to-end staged workflow, subagent-driven development with phased review, TDD Red-Green-Refactor, git-worktree isolation, Socratic brainstorming, a composable skill library | The whole `spec → ship` pipeline backbone, splitting work across role-specialized subagents, mandatory TDD, multi-stage / adversarial review, and dialogue-first requirement clarification |
| [**ECC**](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) (affaan-m) — an agent-harness "operating system" | A large layered system of agents / skills / hooks / rules, passive hooks that auto-enforce, rules-as-infrastructure, memory persistence across sessions | The layered, independently-installable sub-plugin suite, passive hooks that enforce discipline, and distilling engineering conventions into loadable constraint skills |
| [**skills**](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills) (mattpocock) — "Skills For Real Engineers" | Targets real failure modes (misalignment / verbosity / quality / architecture), deep questioning to align on intent, shared domain language, user- vs model-invoked skills, vertical slicing | Challenge-first dialogue to pin down requirements before any code, dual-trigger skills (slash command + model auto-trigger), and the one-rule-per-file minimalism |

**Where BB-Spec goes its own way** — differentiators none of the three combine:

- **Three-agent isolated execution** — the Impl agent *physically never sees the spec*, only the tests, so it cannot quietly "teach to intent"; tests, implementation, and review are written by mutually-blind agents.
- **Disk documents as the only handoff** — every stage hands off a file, not chat memory, so a run resumes losslessly across sessions, `/clear`, or even a different model picking up the work.
- **Bidirectional spec ⇄ code loop** — not just spec → code: `/doc-update` sweeps the whole repo and updates specs as the code drifts.
