# opencode-mnemosyne

OpenCode plugin for **local persistent memory** using [Mnemosyne](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne). Gives your AI coding agent memory that persists across sessions -- entirely offline, no cloud APIs.

This is the local/offline alternative to cloud-based memory plugins like opencode-supermemory.

## Prerequisites

Install the mnemosyne binary first:

```bash
# From source (requires Go 1.21+, GCC, Task)
git clone https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne.git
cd mnemosyne
task install
```

See the [mnemosyne README](https://github.com/gandazgul/mnemosyne#quick-start) for detailed setup instructions. On first use, mnemosyne will automatically download its ML models (~500 MB one-time).

## Install

Add to your `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-mnemosyne"]
}
```

That's it. OpenCode will install the plugin automatically.

## What it does

### Tools

The plugin registers five tools available to the AI agent:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_recall` | Search project memory for relevant context and past decisions |
| `memory_recall_global` | Search global memory for cross-project preferences |
| `memory_store` | Store a project-scoped memory (optionally as `core`) |
| `memory_store_global` | Store a cross-project memory (optionally as `core`) |
| `memory_delete` | Delete an outdated memory by its document ID |

### Hooks

- **`experimental.session.compacting`** -- Injects memory tool instructions into the compaction prompt so the agent retains awareness of its memory capabilities across context window resets.

### Memory scoping

| Scope | Collection | Persists across |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Project | `<directory-name>` | Sessions in the same project |
| Global | `global` | All projects |
| Core (project) | `<directory-name>` (tagged `core`) | Sessions + survives compaction |
| Core (global) | `global` (tagged `core`) | All projects + survives compaction |

The project collection is auto-initialized when the plugin loads. The global collection is created on first use of `mnemosyne add -g` or the equivalent global store tool.

## AGENTS.md (recommended)

For best results, add this to your project or global `AGENTS.md` so the agent uses memory proactively from the start of each session:

```markdown
## Memory System

- Use `mnemosyne search -f plain [query]` and `mnemosyne search -g -f plain [query]` to search relevant memories. Use this before making any decisions or taking any actions.
- After significant decisions, use `mnemosyne add "memory content"` to save a concise fact you want to remember. Also do this if the user explicitly asks you to remember something. Use `mnemosyne add -g "memory content"` for cross-project preferences.
- Delete contradicted memories with `mnemosyne delete [memory id]` after storing updated ones with `mnemosyne add ...` or `mnemosyne add -g ...`.
- Mark critical, always-relevant context as core with `-t core`, but use it sparingly. You can also use other tags with repeated `-t` flags, such as `mnemosyne add "database is sqlite" -t core -t tech-stack`.
- When you are done with a session, store any memories that you think are relevant to the user and the project. This will help you recall important information in future sessions.
```

## How it works

Mnemosyne is a local document store with hybrid search:
- **Full-text search** (SQLite FTS5, BM25 ranking)
- **Vector search** (sqlite-vec, cosine similarity with snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5)
- **Reciprocal Rank Fusion** combines both for best results

All ML inference runs locally via ONNX Runtime. Your memories never leave your machine.

## Development

This project uses standard Node.js tools: `npm` for package management and `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) for building.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Start the compiler in watch mode for development
npm run dev

# Run TypeScript checks
npm run typecheck
```
