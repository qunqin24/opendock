# Agent Workforce Skills

Skills, slash commands, and a Claude Code plugin for building multi-agent systems with Agent Relay.

Package metadata lives in [prpm.json](prpm.json). The repo currently publishes `agent-workforce-skills` version `1.9.0`.

## Published Skills

| Skill | Version | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| [choosing-swarm-patterns](skills/choosing-swarm-patterns/SKILL.md) | 1.1.5 | Pick the right Agent Relay orchestration pattern across the 10 core swarm patterns plus specialized patterns. |
| [writing-agent-relay-workflows](skills/writing-agent-relay-workflows/SKILL.md) | 2.0.0 | **DEPRECATED** - the superseded v1 `@relayflows/core` WorkflowBuilder engine. Use [`writing-relayflows`](skills/writing-relayflows/SKILL.md) for v2; keep this only to maintain an existing v1 workflow. |
| [setting-up-relayfile](skills/setting-up-relayfile/SKILL.md) | 1.1.2 | Set up Relayfile mounts and writeback for provider files through local filesystem access. |
| [setting-up-agent-relay-desktop](skills/setting-up-agent-relay-desktop/SKILL.md) | 1.1.10 | Install and configure Agent Relay Desktop end-to-end from a Codex or Claude session, including headless Linux, device login, registration, webhooks, integrations, and verification. |
| [setting-up-agent-relay-sessions](skills/setting-up-agent-relay-sessions/SKILL.md) | 0.2.8 | Set a person up for live agent-to-agent session handoff end-to-end from a Codex or Claude session: reuse `setting-up-agent-relay-desktop` for the desktop leg, install the agent-sessions cloud MCP before the session starts, confirm the handoff tools loaded, and prove a live round trip with a teammate (or self-verify the roster + own-session read path when no teammate is online yet). |
| [signing-in-to-agent-relay-cloud](skills/signing-in-to-agent-relay-cloud/SKILL.md) | 0.1.0 | Sign a person in to Agent Relay Cloud through the OAuth device flow from an agent session: device grant, polling, refresh, whoami, and the CLI credential handoff, with no token printed. |
| [setting-up-agent-relay-flows](skills/setting-up-agent-relay-flows/SKILL.md) | 0.1.0 | Choose a catalog flow and repository, connect tools and coding-agent credentials, activate the listener through the direct-source deploy API, and verify it is listening. Builds on `signing-in-to-agent-relay-cloud`. |
| [subscribing-relay-webhooks-and-writebacks](skills/subscribing-relay-webhooks-and-writebacks/SKILL.md) | 0.1.7 | Subscribe a session to GitHub PR and Slack channel events so they are injected, and write back to providers through a Relayfile mount, with the verified steps and known defects. |
| [messaging-agents-on-the-relay](skills/messaging-agents-on-the-relay/SKILL.md) | 0.1.2 | Find other agents on Agent Relay and message them from a registered desktop session with no tokens: roster, send, reply, the macOS Codex probe form, and safety rules. |
| [relay-connect](skills/relay-connect/SKILL.md) | 0.5.0 | Create or join a temporary Relay Connect with the native `agent-relay-probe connect` commands after one verified install; guests need no account. |
| [writing-relayflows](skills/writing-relayflows/SKILL.md) | 1.6.2 | Author a Relayflows v2 flow (`@relayflows/surface`/`@relayflows/sdk`, the `flows` CLI) in TypeScript or YAML/JSON — including direct `use`/`f.dispatch` child flows, local-run Cloud dashboard mirroring, and the hosted `use` limitation. Not the older `@relayflows/core` WorkflowBuilder engine. |
| [migrating-persona-to-relayflow](skills/migrating-persona-to-relayflow/SKILL.md) | 1.1.0 | Migrate an existing `defineAgent` persona to run its LLM-heavy work through a Relayflow v1 workflow via `ctx.workflow.run()`: scope decisions, the 4-step durable-workflow shape, colocation, red-first and resume tests, `useSubscription` semantics, and the `agentworkforce` >= 4.1.44 CI-deploy bump. |
| [using-agent-relay](skills/using-agent-relay/SKILL.md) | 1.4.0 | Participant-side MCP reference for a **registered** relay agent (spawned worker / registered lead): messaging, channels, threads, reactions, search, inbox, actions, and worker spawn/release. Counterpart to `orchestrating-agent-relay`. |
| [orchestrating-agent-relay](skills/orchestrating-agent-relay/SKILL.md) | 2.4.1 | The canonical way to run agent-relay: self-bootstrap the broker (`agent-relay node up`) and autonomously spawn, monitor, and coordinate a worker team over the relay MCP without human intervention, including GitHub PR-owner integration subscriptions. |
| [relay-80-100-workflow](skills/relay-80-100-workflow/SKILL.md) | 2.1.1 | Close the 80-to-100 validation gap in a Relayflows v2 flow: the evidence recorder that turns a red check into work for a repair agent, repairable gates on the critical path, edit and hazard gates, when *not* to add a repair step, and the fresh-eyes review rounds that catch what green gates miss. |
| [review-fix-signoff-loop](skills/review-fix-signoff-loop/SKILL.md) | 1.0.2 | Loop review, repair, validation, and fresh-context dual-agent signoff until independent reviewers both satisfy the verdict contract. |
| [trigger-autocomplete-catalog](skills/trigger-autocomplete-catalog/SKILL.md) | 1.0.0 | Enforce webhook/event trigger autocomplete coverage through KNOWN_TRIGGER_CATALOG in @relayfile/adapter-core. |
| [activity-summary](skills/activity-summary/SKILL.md) | 1.0.0 | Answer "what did I work on yesterday" questions by reading `digests/yesterday.md` first instead of crawling provider directories. |
| [daily-digest](skills/daily-digest/SKILL.md) | 1.0.0 | Authoring contract for `<mount>/digests/` files — windows, per-provider sections, adapter `digest()` exports, regeneration rules. |
| [writeback-as-files](skills/writeback-as-files/SKILL.md) | 1.0.0 | File-creation writeback contract — drop a JSON file at the canonical path and relayfile delivers the mutation, with dead-letter recovery. |
| [workspace-layout](skills/workspace-layout/SKILL.md) | 1.0.1 | Navigate a relayfile mount via root and per-provider `LAYOUT.md` files plus `by-*` alias indexes instead of `find`/`grep -r`. |
| [connecting-agents-across-machines](skills/connecting-agents-across-machines/SKILL.md) | 1.0.3 | Coordinate agents across two or more of your own machines — one shared workspace, a node per machine, cross-machine DMs and targeted spawns, verified agent-to-agent. |
| [multi-host-live-mount](skills/multi-host-live-mount/SKILL.md) | 1.0.1 | Mount one workspace on many hosts and place an agent in a live-mounted tree with nothing cloned — join, per-node scopes and credentials, and proof the remote mirror is current. |
| [adding-swarm-patterns](skills/adding-swarm-patterns/SKILL.md) | 1.0.0 | Checklist for extending agent-relay with a new swarm pattern — TypeScript types, JSON schema, YAML template, and pattern/template docs. |
| [creating-cloud-persona](skills/creating-cloud-persona/SKILL.md) | 1.0.11 | Create or update a Workforce cloud persona with `persona.json`/`persona.ts`, `agent.ts`, integration scope and adapter config guidance, vendored examples, and production-correctness checks. |
| [factory-config](skills/factory-config/SKILL.md) | 1.0.2 | Create and validate Agent Relay Factory configs for repo routing, Linear states, GitHub issue ingestion, Slack, babysitter mode, and Relayflows dispatch wiring boundaries. |
| [openclaw-orchestrator](skills/openclaw-orchestrator/SKILL.md) | 2.0.0 | OpenClaw-specific setup and completion reporting for a headless Agent Relay team; defers to `orchestrating-agent-relay` for broker, spawn, and coordination mechanics. |

## Slash Commands

| Command | Version | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| [/create-workflow](commands/create-workflow.md) | 1.0.5 | Scaffold a model-agnostic Agent Relay workflow using the workflow and swarm-pattern skills, including selected review-depth review/fix loops with test hardening. |
| [/spawn](commands/spawn.md) | 1.1.0 | Bootstrap the broker (`agent-relay node up`) and spawn a worker for `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `droid`, `gemini`, or `pi`. |
| [/review-loop](commands/review-loop.md) | 1.0.1 | Run a dual-reviewer code-review loop with repair and fresh-context signoff. |

## Claude Code Teams Plugin

Install [`agent-relay-teams`](plugins/claude/agent-relay-teams) from the `agent-relay` marketplace to coordinate Claude Code sub-agents:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add AgentWorkforce/skills
/plugin install agent-relay-teams@agent-relay
```

## Grok Build Plugin

[`plugins/grok/agent-relay`](plugins/grok/agent-relay) puts a Grok Build session on Agent Relay: setup and messaging skills and a `/relay-leader-mode` command. Messages from other agents arrive in the Grok TUI in real time through the Agent Relay desktop (Grok leader mode required).

```bash
grok plugin install AgentWorkforce/skills#plugins/grok/agent-relay --trust
```

## Claude Code Channel Plugin

[`agent-relay-channel`](plugins/claude/agent-relay-channel) is a Claude Code [channel](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/channels): relay messages from other agents arrive in your running session in real time and Claude answers with a `reply` tool, gated by pairing and a sender allowlist.

```
/plugin marketplace add AgentWorkforce/skills
/plugin install agent-relay-channel@agent-relay
/agent-relay-channel:configure
```

Then restart with the channel on; during the research preview: `claude --dangerously-load-development-channels plugin:agent-relay-channel@agent-relay`. See the [plugin README](plugins/claude/agent-relay-channel/README.md) for pairing and requirements (Bun 1.4+).

### Migrating the Claude plugins

The old identifiers are not aliases. Uninstall `claude-relay-plugin@agent-relay`
and install `agent-relay-teams@agent-relay`; uninstall
`agent-relay@agent-relay` and install `agent-relay-channel@agent-relay`.
Channel users must also replace the old plugin identifier in their
`--dangerously-load-development-channels` launch command. Existing channel
settings under `~/.claude/channels/agent-relay/` are reused.

## OpenCode Plugin

[`plugins/opencode/agent-relay`](plugins/opencode/agent-relay) is the npm package `@agent-relay/opencode-plugin`: it lets the Agent Relay desktop deliver relay messages into an open OpenCode session and read the answer back. Add `"plugins": ["@agent-relay/opencode-plugin"]` to OpenCode V2's `opencode.json` (`"plugin"` on V1). It stays out of the way when the desktop has installed its own copy.

## Install Packages

Install an individual skill or slash command with `prpm` using the scoped package name: `@agent-relay/${skillName}`.

```bash
npx prpm install @agent-relay/choosing-swarm-patterns
```

Or install directly from this GitHub repo with `skills`:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/agentworkforce/skills --skill choosing-swarm-patterns
```

Install the `agent-relay-starter` collection with `prpm` when you want the core workflow authoring stack in multiple CLI tools:

```bash
npx prpm install collections/agent-relay-starter --as codex,claude
```

This collection includes:

- `@agent-relay/choosing-swarm-patterns`
- `@agent-relay/writing-relayflows`
- `@agent-workforce/trail-snippet`
- optional `@agent-relay/relay-80-100-workflow`
- optional `@agent-relay/review-fix-signoff-loop`
- optional `@agent-relay/writing-agent-relay-workflows` (deprecated v1 engine)

Install the `relayfile-workspace` collection when you want the full Relayfile workspace primitive stack:

```bash
npx prpm install collections/relayfile-workspace --as codex,claude
```

This collection includes:

- `@agent-relay/activity-summary`
- `@agent-relay/daily-digest`
- `@agent-relay/workspace-layout`
- `@agent-relay/writeback-as-files`
- `@agent-relay/multi-host-live-mount`

### Agent Relay setup skills

`setting-up-agent-relay-desktop`, `setting-up-agent-relay-sessions`, `subscribing-relay-webhooks-and-writebacks` and `messaging-agents-on-the-relay` build on each other (the other three all need a working, signed-in desktop). Install them together so the references resolve.

With `prpm`, install the `agent-relay-setup` collection for Claude Code:

```bash
npx prpm install collections/agent-relay-setup --as claude --global -y
```

For Codex, do **not** use `--as codex` for these skills: the conversion drops explanatory paragraphs from the workflows and writes under `~/.agents/skills`, which Codex does not load as its global skill folder. Mirror the installed `SKILL.md` files into `~/.codex/skills/<name>/` instead:

```bash
(
  set -e
  for pkg in setting-up-agent-relay-desktop setting-up-agent-relay-sessions subscribing-relay-webhooks-and-writebacks messaging-agents-on-the-relay; do
    src="$HOME/.claude/skills/$pkg/SKILL.md"
    test -f "$src" || { echo "missing $src: run the prpm --as claude install first" >&2; exit 1; }
    mkdir -p "$HOME/.codex/skills/$pkg"
    install -m 0644 "$src" "$HOME/.codex/skills/$pkg/SKILL.md"
    cmp "$src" "$HOME/.codex/skills/$pkg/SKILL.md"
  done
) && echo "mirrored to ~/.codex/skills"
```

With `skills` (which has no dependency or collection concept, so name all four):

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/AgentWorkforce/skills \
  --skill setting-up-agent-relay-desktop \
  --skill setting-up-agent-relay-sessions \
  --skill subscribing-relay-webhooks-and-writebacks \
  --skill messaging-agents-on-the-relay
```

Add `-g` for a user-level install, or `--agent claude-code` to pick a tool. (`--agent codex` writes to `./.agents/skills`; use the `~/.codex/skills` mirror above if you need Codex to load them globally.) The sessions, subscribing and messaging skills stop and tell you which companion to install if the desktop skill is missing; the desktop skill is the foundation and has no companion requirement.

### Agent Relay Cloud and Flows setup skills

`signing-in-to-agent-relay-cloud` and `setting-up-agent-relay-flows` are standalone packages, not members of `agent-relay-setup`, because Flows needs no desktop. `setting-up-agent-relay-flows` builds on `signing-in-to-agent-relay-cloud`, and its custom-flow path on `writing-relayflows`, so install the three together:

```bash
npx prpm install @agent-relay/signing-in-to-agent-relay-cloud --as claude --global -y
npx prpm install @agent-relay/setting-up-agent-relay-flows --as claude --global -y
npx prpm install @agent-relay/writing-relayflows --as claude --global -y
```

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/AgentWorkforce/skills \
  --skill signing-in-to-agent-relay-cloud \
  --skill setting-up-agent-relay-flows \
  --skill writing-relayflows
```

The agentrelay.com agent signup guides (`/signup/agent/teams` and `/signup/agent/flows`) include these skills verbatim from a pinned commit, so an agent following a signup link needs no install.

See [prpm.dev](https://prpm.dev/) and the [prpm docs](https://docs.prpm.dev/) for collection installs and CLI target options.
