OpenCode Heads Up is a heads-up display (HUD) with per-turn telemetry
for both local inference engines and remote models. It contains a
universal layer of baseline metrics along with any additional data from
the provider.


```

Two boxes, each opened and closed by clicking its heading: the last turn,
and the session so far.

Requires [**OpenCode 2**](https://opencode.ai/v2/docs). For the v1 line

## Install

```bash
opencode plugin add @banburist/opencode-headsup
```

Restart OpenCode. The panel appears in the sidebar footer after the first
turn. `opencode plugin list` shows what is installed; `plugin update` and
`plugin remove` handle the rest.

Equivalent, if you keep your config in version control:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/opencode/cli.json
{
  "plugins": ["@banburist/opencode-headsup"]
}
```

## Keys

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `ctrl+shift+m` | Collapse/expand the last-turn box. Clicking its heading does the same. |
| `ctrl+shift+h` | Open/close the per-turn history panel. |

Both are registered with stable command ids (`headsup.toggle`,
`headsup.panel`), so they can be remapped from your own OpenCode keybind
config and are reachable from the command palette.

The Session box has no key; click its heading. Collapsed, each box keeps
one figure rather than becoming a bare label:

```
▸ MTPLX · last turn  34.4 tok/s
```

## Configuration

Two keys, because two things are genuinely preferences. Everything else
appears exactly when its underlying data exists and stays silent when it
does not — there is nothing to choose.

```jsonc
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "package": "@banburist/opencode-headsup",
      "options": { "showContext": false, "background": true }
    }
  ]
}
```

**showContext** (default `false`)

Adds a `13% prompt/limit` line, computed as
`tokens.input / ModelInfo.limit.context` based on the model's
config in `opencode.json`. Labeled as `prompt/limit` rather than
`context used`.

**background** (default `true`)

Puts your theme's offset panel shade behind each box. Turn it off for a
theme or terminal with a transparent background, where the shade can
disappear.

### Endpoints

Engine endpoints use the defaults below, overridable per key or by env var.
An engine that is not running just falls back to the universal layer.

| Option | Env | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `mtplxMetricsUrl` | `MTPLX_METRICS_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics` |
| `omlxBaseUrl` | `OMLX_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8099` |
| `omlxApiKey` | `OMLX_API_KEY` | *(none — required to read oMLX)* |
| `llamacppBaseUrl` | `LLAMACPP_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` |
| `llamafileBaseUrl` | `LLAMAFILE_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8003` |
| `vllmBaseUrl` | `VLLM_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` |
| `sglangBaseUrl` | `SGLANG_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:30000` |
| `vllmMlxBaseUrl` | `VLLM_MLX_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` |
| `aphroditeBaseUrl` | `APHRODITE_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:2242` |
| `lmdeployBaseUrl` | `LMDEPLOY_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:23333` |
| `splashBaseUrl` | `SPLASH_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` |
| `koboldcppBaseUrl` | `KOBOLDCPP_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:5001` |
| `mlxServeBaseUrl` | `MLXSERVE_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8095` |
| `mlxServeApiKey` | `MLX_API_KEY` | *(unset)* |

`OPENCODE_HUD_DEBUG=1` logs adapter failures to
`/tmp/opencode-headsup-debug.log`. Adapter throws are swallowed by design so
a broken engine never blanks the panel; this is how you see them.

## Supported Engines

Providers get the **universal** line from OpenCode's own per-turn data —
rate, TTFT, exact token counts, cost and cache reuse; supported engines
provide their own telemetry instead. See
[Adding an Engine](#adding-an-engine).

For local engines, the provider id in `opencode.json` must **exactly
match** the provider ids below, otherwise no data will be passed to the
plugin.

| Provider | tok/s | TTFT | Prefill tok/s | Exact tokens | Cache info | Extras | First turn | Validated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`mtplx`](#mtplx) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | MTP accept % | ✅ | live |
| [`omlx`](#omlx) | ✅ | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ | live |
| [`llamacpp`](#llamacpp) | ✅ | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | — | 🟡 | live |
| [`llamafile`](#llamafile) | ✅ | 🟡 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | — | 🟡 | live |

### Key

- ✅ Provided by the engine
- 🟡 Provided by OpenCode's universal layer, labelled `(host)` on the panel

  OpenCode's telemetry spans queue, network and event delivery as well as
  prefill, so it is not the same measurement an engine reports.
- ❌ Not available

### Validated
- **live**: run against a real server, deltas checked against its own
  response.
- **derived**: a real vLLM capture with the metric prefix swapped
  (Aphrodite is a vLLM fork, identical shape).
- **synthetic**: values fixed by hand from the engine's source to make
  the arithmetic checkable, not measured — `aphrodite` and `lmdeploy`
  are both CUDA-only and unavailable here.

Per-file provenance is located in
[`fixtures/README.md`](fixtures/README.md).

### First Turn Data

Most engines expose **cumulative counters**, not per-request figures: total
tokens decoded since launch, total milliseconds spent decoding. A single
reading says nothing about one turn. The figure for a turn is the difference
between a reading taken before it and one taken after, which means the first
turn after OpenCode starts has nothing to subtract from.

- ✅ — engine telemetry from the very first turn. These publish a *last
  request* figure (`mtplx`, `koboldcpp`) or an identifiable per-request
  record (`mlxserve`), so one reading is enough. `omlx` is primed like the
  🟡 engines below; when it has no reading yet, it still renders, with
  server-lifetime averages labelled `(avg)`.
- 🟡 — primed: when a turn starts on one of these engines and there is no
  reading yet, that one engine is read before the request reaches it, so
  the first turn has engine telemetry too. The exception is a brand-new
  session that has not used or selected a model yet: OpenCode does not tell
  plugins which model it will use, so that first turn shows the universal
  line, then engine telemetry from the second turn on. Nothing is broken
  and nothing is lost; a rate invented from a single counter reading would
  describe the whole server's history, not your turn.
- — — no adapter, so the universal layer is all there is, on every turn.

The baseline lives in memory for the life of the TUI, so this applies once
per OpenCode session rather than once per install. Nothing is read at
startup, and an engine you are not using is never read.

## Engine Details

<a id="mtplx"></a>

### `mtplx` — MTPLX

Default `http://127.0.0.1:8000/metrics`. No think/answer split — `/metrics`
never reports `reasoning_tokens`.

<a id="omlx"></a>

### `omlx` — oMLX

Default `http://127.0.0.1:8099`. Requires `omlxApiKey`. No TTFT: its
counters are atomic at completion, so there is nothing to time a first
token against.

<a id="llamacpp"></a>

### `llamacpp` — llama.cpp

Default port 8080, needs `--metrics` (off by default). Use the classic
single-model `llama-server`, not the multi-model router — different
`/props` shape.

```bash
llama-server --hf-repo <user>/<repo> --hf-file <file>.gguf \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --metrics
```

No cache-hit counter, so prompt tokens read low on a cache hit rather than
reporting what was reused.

<a id="llamafile"></a>

### `llamafile` — llamafile

Default port 8003. Publishes identical `llamacpp:` metric names, so it
shares that adapter and can run alongside a real llama.cpp instance.

```bash
llamafile -m model.gguf --server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8003 --metrics
```

<a id="mlxserve"></a>

### `mlxserve` — mlx-serve

Default port 8095. This is
[raspoli/mlx-serve](https://github.com/raspoli/mlx-serve), not
`mlx_lm.server` itself. Set `mlxServeApiKey` if it runs with `MLX_API_KEY`.
Matches turns by request id, so multi-request turns are summed rather than
dropped. A streamed request reports no prompt count; a non-streamed one has
no separate decode rate. Cold starts are flagged — a model swap runs ~10x
longer than a warm turn.

<a id="splash"></a>

### `splash` — Splash

Default port 8000, nothing to enable. Apple Silicon only.

```bash
splash serve --model <owner/repo>
splash opencode --standalone
```

`--standalone` is required on OpenCode 2. `splash opencode` injects its
provider through `OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`, which only the process that
loads config reads — and v2 runs a persistent background server that the TUI
merely connects to. Without a private server the variable never reaches the
process that would act on it, so Splash is not registered as a provider at
all and OpenCode silently opens on whatever model it already had. Reported
upstream.

Port 8000 is also `vllm`'s and `vllmmlx`'s default here. If you run more
than one of them, give Splash its own port with `splash serve --port`, and
set `splashBaseUrl` to match — otherwise whichever server is listening
answers for whichever provider you pick, and you get a confusing `model not
found` rather than a connection error.

Both phases are engine-timed, and prefill stays honest on a cache hit — it
counts only recomputed tokens, never the whole prompt.

<a id="koboldcpp"></a>

### `koboldcpp` — KoboldCpp

Default port 5001, nothing to enable. Mac arm64 binary is 64MB.

```bash
./koboldcpp --model <model.gguf> --port 5001
```

Prefill/decode arrive already timed. A partial cache hit overstates prefill
— there is no cached-token counter to correct it with. Streaming emits no
usage chunk, so this endpoint is the *only* source of token counts on a
streamed turn.

<a id="vllm"></a>

### `vllm` — vLLM

Default port 8000. On Apple Silicon,
[vllm-metal](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-metal) runs upstream vLLM
unchanged. Decode rate reuses OpenCode's turn timing — there is no
per-request duration histogram. TTFT is engine-reported.

<a id="sglang"></a>

### `sglang` — SGLang

Default port 30000, needs `--enable-metrics`. On Apple Silicon its MLX
backend works despite the docs not saying so:

```bash
SGLANG_USE_MLX=1 python -m sglang.launch_server \
  --model-path <mlx-model> --disable-cuda-graph --enable-metrics
```

(the published docs name an `all_mps` extra the shipped pyproject lacks;
the real one is `srt_mps`). `cached_tokens_total` is registered lazily and
absent until the first cache hit. On a non-streaming turn TTFT is stamped
at completion, collapsing onto total latency.

<a id="vllmmlx"></a>

### `vllmmlx` — vllm-mlx

Default port 8000 — conflicts with `vllm`. `pip install vllm-mlx`, then
start with `--enable-metrics` (not `--metrics`, despite some docs):

```bash
vllm-mlx serve mlx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-4bit --port 8000 --enable-metrics
```

The only engine here with a true decode rate excluding prefill, from its own
duration histogram. Drops the per-request rate rather than report a blended
one when several requests land in one window.

<a id="aphrodite"></a>

### `aphrodite` — Aphrodite

Default port 2242, CUDA host. A vLLM fork publishing vLLM's shape under an
`aphrodite:` prefix, so it behaves like [`vllm`](#vllm). Not independently
live-tested.

<a id="lmdeploy"></a>

### `lmdeploy` — LMDeploy

Default port 23333, needs `--enable-metrics`, CUDA host. The richest
surface here — prefill and decode are both separately timed histograms, so
neither rate is derived. Not independently live-tested.

<a id="anything-else"></a>

### Anything else (Ollama, MLX-LM, LM Studio, …)

Universal layer only, which on v2 still includes exact token counts, cost
and cache reuse. Ollama: `baseURL: "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"`; its own
telemetry is per-caller, not server-wide. MLX-LM has no server-wide
`/metrics` at all.

## Adding an Engine

Same shape for any OpenAI-compatible server:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
{
  "provider": {
    "<provider-id>": {
      "name": "Display name",
      "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
      "options": { "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:<port>/v1", "apiKey": "anything" },
      "models": {
        "<model id the server reports at /v1/models>": {
          "name": "Display name for the model",
          "limit": { "context": 32768, "output": 8192 },
          "modalities": { "input": ["text"], "output": ["text"] },
          "tool_call": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Important Notes

### tok/s is generation speed; the total is what you waited

`tok/s` is tokens over the time spent streaming after the first token —
raw generation speed. OpenCode's own tok/s, in the footer under each turn,
divides by each step's time from the request to the end of streaming: it
leaves out time spent running tools, but includes prefill and the wait for
the first token. On a turn with a long wait before the first token the two
differ widely (measured: 38.1 tok/s over a 0.97s decode window against 3.7
over the same turn's 10.03s; on MTPLX with a 17.6s prefill, 35.2 against
OpenCode's 13.1). Both are correct; the TTFT
beside the rate is what reconciles them. A turn that cannot be timed
from its stream shows no rate rather than a whole-turn figure.

A large prefill shows in TTFT, in the prefill rate where the engine
reports one, and in the total — never in `tok/s`. The total runs from
the request to the end of the turn, and names any retries OpenCode made:
`60.00s (6 retries)`.

A turn that calls tools is several requests, one per step. Its tokens,
cost and cache reuse are summed over every step; its `tok/s` covers only
the steps' own streaming, never the time spent running tools.

### Every figure is one turn, never a running total

Four things in this API are cumulative where a per-turn figure is
expected — `session.usage.updated`, `session.cost()`, raw engine
counters, and `time.streamed` (which is stamped at the *end* of the
stream, not the start, and is therefore not a TTFT). The per-turn
figures here are differenced or measured accordingly.

A counter difference is only one turn's when the requests that reached the
engine between the two readings are this turn's own — one per step — and
its token count equals OpenCode's for the turn. OpenCode's own background
work (a new session's title, compaction), a turn you interrupted that kept
generating, or another tab or client sharing the server all break that, and
no engine here labels its counters by request or session to separate them
again. So a turn that shared its window shows the universal line with
`engine data skipped: overlapping requests` rather than figures that
describe several requests at once. This applies to every engine that
differences counters: the Prometheus engines, `llamacpp`, `llamafile`,
`splash` and `omlx`, checked against the turn's tokens and, where the
engine counts requests, against its steps. Verified live on vllm-mlx; the
others are built from their live captures.

`mtplx`, `koboldcpp` and `mlxserve` report only the engine's latest
request, so they are read at the end of every step and the steps' receipts
combined: tokens summed, the rate over every step's decode time, TTFT and
prefill from the first step, the step that read the context. Each receipt
must match OpenCode's count for its step, or the turn shows the universal
line with the notice. Verified live on MTPLX; KoboldCpp and mlx-serve are
built from their live captures but not yet run step by step against a live
server.

### Absent is not zero

A free model shows no cost rather than `$0.00`, a cold prompt shows no
cache line rather than `0 cached`, and a missing speculative-draft
counter shows nothing rather than `0% accepted`.
