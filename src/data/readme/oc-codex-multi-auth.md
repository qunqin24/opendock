`oc-codex-multi-auth` is an OpenCode plugin for ChatGPT Plus/Pro OAuth, Codex and GPT-5 model routing (including GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna), multi-account rotation, account switching, health checks, quota visibility, diagnostics, and recovery tools. It installs the OpenCode provider/TUI configuration, registers a 24-tool `codex-*` command toolkit, and routes OpenCode OpenAI SDK requests through the ChatGPT-backed Codex flow with local account state.

Use it when you want OpenCode to run Codex-style coding workflows from your own ChatGPT subscription while keeping accounts visible, switchable, health-checked, and recoverable from the terminal.

## Why Developers Use It

`oc-codex-multi-auth` makes OpenCode's ChatGPT OAuth state understandable and operable. Instead of treating auth as one opaque provider file, you get a local account pool, deterministic account switching, health-aware request selection, visible quota status, JSON-friendly diagnostics, and safe repair commands for stale or damaged state. The plugin is designed for personal development workflows: credentials stay local, OpenCode keeps owning the host runtime, and the plugin only handles the OAuth-backed Codex routing layer it is installed for.

---

## Current Architecture At A Glance

`oc-codex-multi-auth` ships four user-visible surfaces:

| Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `oc-codex-multi-auth` | npm CLI; explicit install modes manage OpenCode provider/TUI config, while `update` only clears the managed package cache. Also runs standalone commands: `doctor`, `status`, `list`, `limits`, `dashboard`, `health`, `diag`, `warm` |
| OpenCode plugin entry (`index.ts`) | auth loader, OAuth login modes, provider fetch pipeline, account rotation, retry/failover, and `codex-*` tool registry |
| OpenCode TUI plugin (`tui.ts`) | prompt quota status, quota details, shared quota cache, and active-account-aware display |
| 24 `codex-*` tools | setup, help, status, list, switch, warm, limits, health, metrics, doctor, dashboard, pool, backup, keychain, diagnostics, and recovery actions |

The plugin does not replace OpenCode. OpenCode remains the host; this package installs provider/TUI config and supplies the OAuth-backed Codex request pipeline that OpenCode calls.

## Installation

<details open>
<summary><b>For Humans</b></summary>

### Option A: Standard install (preserve provider config)

Default mode registers the OpenCode and TUI plugin entries without changing `provider.openai`.

```bash
npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest
```

Installer flags:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| (default) / `--plugin-only` | Register the plugin and TUI integration without changing `provider.openai` |
| `--modern` | Install compact modern catalog: 12 bases, 53 variants |
| `--full` | Compact bases plus 53 explicit selector IDs |
| `--legacy` | Explicit-only catalog for older OpenCode |
| `--dry-run` | Show changed config paths without values or writes |
| `--no-cache-clear` | Skip clearing the OpenCode plugin cache |

### Option B: Compact modern model catalog

```bash
npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest --modern
```

Use this when OpenCode does not already provide the OAuth model definitions or you want the shipped variant presets.

### Option C: Full explicit model catalog

Use this when you want direct selector IDs such as `openai/gpt-5.5-medium` in addition to OpenCode variants.

```bash
npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest --full
```

### Updating without config changes

```bash
npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest update
```

`update` clears only the OpenCode-managed package cache. It does not read or write `opencode.json` or `tui.json`; restart OpenCode afterward to install the current package.

### Option D: Verify wiring

```bash
opencode --version
opencode debug config
opencode auth login
```

The default installer only normalizes the plugin entry in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, enables the TUI status plugin in `~/.config/opencode/tui.json`, and clears the cached plugin copy. Catalog modes additionally merge their selected `provider.openai` definitions. Changed config files are backed up before writing.

### Standalone CLI (no agent / no token cost)

```bash
oc-codex-multi-auth status
oc-codex-multi-auth list
oc-codex-multi-auth warm
oc-codex-multi-auth doctor
oc-codex-multi-auth health
oc-codex-multi-auth limits
oc-codex-multi-auth dashboard
oc-codex-multi-auth diag
# or: npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest warm --json
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>For LLM Agents</b></summary>

### Step-by-step

1. Register the plugin without changing `provider.openai`:
   - `npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest`
   - Use `--modern` only when the shipped compact model catalog is required.
2. Run first login flow:
   - `opencode auth login`
3. Validate config:
   - `opencode debug config`
4. Run a smoke request (after OpenCode or `--modern` supplies the selector):
   - `opencode run "Explain this repository" --model=openai/gpt-5.5 --variant=medium`
5. Inspect plugin state with the OpenCode tool surface:
   - `codex-status`
   - `codex-doctor`
   - `codex-list`

### Verification

```bash
opencode debug config
opencode auth login
opencode run "ping" --model=openai/gpt-5.5 --variant=medium
```

</details>

---

## Quick Start

Install and sign in:

```bash
npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest
opencode auth login
```

Run a prompt with compact modern selectors:

```bash
opencode run "Summarize the failing test and suggest a fix" --model=openai/gpt-5.5 --variant=medium
opencode run "Summarize the failing test and suggest a fix" --model=openai/gpt-5.5-fast --variant=medium
opencode run "Plan the refactor" --model=openai/gpt-5.6-sol --variant=high
```

Use Codex-focused routing:

```bash
opencode run "Refactor the retry logic and update the tests" --model=openai/gpt-5-codex --variant=high
```

If browser launch is blocked, use the alternate login paths in [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md#remote-or-headless-login).

## Command Toolkit

### Start here

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-setup` | How do I finish first-run setup safely? |
| `codex-help` | Which plugin commands exist and what do they do? |
| `codex-doctor` | What is wrong with auth, config, storage, or routing? |
| `codex-next` | What should I do next to get unstuck? |

### Daily use

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-list` | Which accounts are saved and which one is active? |
| `codex-switch` | How do I move to a different saved account? |
| `codex-warm` | How do I start every account's usage window now (stagger quota cooldowns)? |
| `codex-status` | Which account, model family, and routing state are active? |
| `codex-limits` | What quota or rate-limit state is visible now? |
| `codex-reset` | Do I have a banked rate-limit reset credit, and how do I redeem it? |
| `codex-dashboard` | Can I manage accounts from one interactive surface? |
| `codex-pool` | Which accounts are preferred for each model, and how do I change them? |

Most of these also run as a **direct CLI** with no agent/model involvement (no token cost) — e.g. `oc-codex-multi-auth warm`, `oc-codex-multi-auth status`, or `npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest warm`. Use `oc-codex-multi-auth warm` to open every enabled account's usage window at the start of a session and stagger the rolling quota cooldowns. Add `--json` for scriptable output.

### Account management

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-label` | How do I name an account? |
| `codex-tag` | How do I group accounts with tags? |
| `codex-note` | How do I attach a private note to an account? |
| `codex-remove` | How do I remove a saved account safely? |
| `codex-refresh` | How do I refresh or re-login an account? |

### Diagnostics and backup

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-health` | Which accounts look healthy, limited, or disabled? |
| `codex-metrics` | What runtime counters and request metrics are visible? |
| `codex-diag` | Can I export a redacted diagnostic snapshot? |
| `codex-diff` | What changed between account/config snapshots? |
| `codex-export` | How do I back up account storage? |
| `codex-import` | How do I restore accounts with a dry-run first? |
| `codex-keychain` | Which credential backend is active and can I migrate it? |

### Reliability behavior

- stateless request handling forces `store: false`
- `reasoning.encrypted_content` is preserved for multi-turn continuity
- GPT-5.6 tiers use the responses-lite request shape and default client identity `opencode`; other models default to `codex_cli_rs`
- account rotation is health-aware (`rotationStrategy` default `hybrid`) and avoids repeatedly selecting cooling accounts
- 5xx bursts, network failures, and quota responses penalize account health
- token refresh is queued to avoid refresh races
- unsupported-model handling is strict by default, with opt-in fallback controls
- TUI quota status follows the account/workspace used by the latest request
- Business workspace memberships and Personal accounts keep separate usage and quota windows. Business members sharing one workspace are distinguished by their member/seat identity, so their usage is not collapsed into one row.

## Storage Paths

| File | Default path |
| --- | --- |
| OpenCode config | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` |
| OpenCode TUI config | `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` |
| OpenCode auth tokens | `~/.opencode/auth/openai.json` |
| Plugin config | `~/.opencode/openai-codex-auth-config.json` |
| Global account storage | `~/.opencode/oc-codex-multi-auth-accounts.json` |
| Per-project accounts | `~/.opencode/projects/<project-key>/oc-codex-multi-auth-accounts.json` |
| Flagged accounts | `~/.opencode/oc-codex-multi-auth-flagged-accounts.json` |
| Backups | `~/.opencode/backups/` or `~/.opencode/projects/<project-key>/backups/` |
| Logs | `~/.opencode/logs/codex-plugin/` |
| TUI quota cache | OpenCode state path plus `~/.opencode/oc-codex-multi-auth-tui-quota.json` fallback |

Per-project storage is enabled by default. The plugin walks up from the current directory to find a project root, then stores account pools under the project-specific key. If no project root is found, it falls back to global storage.

---

## Configuration

Primary config files:

- `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`
- `~/.config/opencode/tui.json`
- `~/.opencode/openai-codex-auth-config.json`

### Route models to preferred accounts

Use `modelAccountPools` to assign one or more preferred ChatGPT accounts or Business seats to a
model. Account references use stable account or Business-seat identities, so
adding, removing, or reordering accounts does not silently change a model's
routing. A Business membership and a Personal account remain separate pool and
usage identities even when they belong to the same login.

```json
{
  "modelAccountPools": {
    "gpt-5.6-sol": [
      "org-example-account-id",
      "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    ],
    "gpt-5.6-terra": [
      "org-another-account-id"
    ]
  },
  "modelAccountPoolModes": {
    "gpt-5.6-sol": "strict",
    "gpt-5.6-terra": "preferred"
  }
}
```

Save this configuration in `~/.opencode/openai-codex-auth-config.json`, then
restart OpenCode. Model matching is case-insensitive and uses the effective
model after request model normalization.

Use `codex-pool` to manage these mappings with ordinary 1-based account
numbers. The tool resolves those numbers and writes stable IDs to disk:

```text
codex-pool
codex-pool action="set" model="gpt-5.6-sol" accounts=[7,8]
codex-pool action="add" model="gpt-5.6-sol" accounts=[9]
codex-pool action="remove" model="gpt-5.6-sol" accounts=[7]
codex-pool action="set-mode" model="gpt-5.6-sol" poolMode="strict"
codex-pool action="clear" model="gpt-5.6-sol"
```

Add `dryRun=true` to preview a mutation. Use `format="json"` for structured
output; stable IDs remain redacted unless `includeSensitive=true` is also set.
Restart OpenCode after an applied mutation. The plugin configuration is global
while account storage is per-project by default, so a reference unresolved in
the current project is reported but never automatically deleted.

Routing behavior:

- A mapped model defaults to `preferred` mode and uses healthy, selectable accounts in its pool.
- Existing rotation strategy, quota, cooldown, and token-health rules still apply within the preferred pool.
- In `preferred` mode, an unavailable pool falls back to the healthy general account pool.
- In `strict` mode, routing never leaves the configured pool and immediately returns `strict_pool_unavailable` when no pooled account is selectable.
- An unmapped model or an empty account list uses the general account pool directly.
- `codex-status`, `codex-dashboard`, and routing diagnostics also report `strict` and `strict-unavailable` modes.

Account IDs are local account metadata but should still be treated as private
configuration. Do not publish a populated configuration file.

Selected runtime/environment overrides:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CODEX_AUTH_REQUEST_TRANSFORM_MODE=legacy` | Re-enable legacy Codex request rewriting |
| `CODEX_MODE=0/1` | Disable/enable bridge prompt behavior |
| `CODEX_TUI_V2=0/1` | Disable/enable codex-style tool output |
| `CODEX_TUI_COLOR_PROFILE=truecolor\|ansi256\|ansi16` | Force terminal color profile |
| `CODEX_TUI_GLYPHS=ascii\|unicode\|auto` | Force terminal glyph style |
| `CODEX_TUI_MASK_EMAIL=0/1` | Mask account emails across account-display surfaces (list/status/limits/health/dashboard/menus + TUI quota status) |
| `CODEX_TUI_MASK_EMAIL_DETAILS=0/1` | Also hide account email in quota details when prompt masking is enabled |
| `CODEX_AUTH_PER_PROJECT_ACCOUNTS=0/1` | Disable/enable per-project account pools |
| `CODEX_AUTH_AUTO_UPDATE=0/1` | Disable/enable daily npm update check and cache refresh |
| `CODEX_AUTH_ROTATION_STRATEGY=hybrid\|sticky\|round-robin` | Account selection strategy |
| `CODEX_AUTH_UNSUPPORTED_MODEL_POLICY=strict\|fallback` | Control unsupported-model retry behavior |
| `CODEX_AUTH_ACCOUNT_ID=<id>` | Force a specific workspace/account id |
| `CODEX_AUTH_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` | Request timeout override |
| `CODEX_AUTH_STREAM_STALL_TIMEOUT_MS=<ms>` | SSE stream stall timeout override |
| `ENABLE_PLUGIN_REQUEST_LOGGING=1` | Enable request metadata logs |
| `CODEX_PLUGIN_LOG_BODIES=1` | Include raw request/response bodies in logs; sensitive |
| `CODEX_KEYCHAIN=1` | Opt in to OS-native keychain account storage |

Boolean env overrides are truthy only for the literal string `"1"`.

Validate config after changes:

```bash
opencode debug config
opencode run "test" --model=openai/gpt-5.5 --variant=medium
```

Modern OpenCode versions use [config/opencode-modern.json](config/opencode-modern.json). Older versions can use [config/opencode-legacy.json](config/opencode-legacy.json). See [config/README.md](config/README.md) for the full model template matrix.

## Credential Storage

<details open>
<summary><b>Default JSON backend</b></summary>

By default, account pools are stored locally as V3 JSON files. File permissions are restricted where the platform supports them.

Use JSON storage when you want predictable, inspectable local files and easy backup/export behavior.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Optional OS keychain backend</b></summary>

Set `CODEX_KEYCHAIN=1` to store account pools in the OS keychain instead:

- macOS: Keychain
- Windows: Credential Manager
- Linux: libsecret, with a running secret service such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet

Manage the backend from OpenCode:

```text
codex-keychain status
codex-keychain migrate
codex-keychain rollback
```

If the keychain is unavailable, the plugin logs a warning and falls back to JSON storage for that operation. Credentials are never silently deleted.

```

If still broken:

```bash
opencode auth login
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Common symptoms</b></summary>

- Plugin does not load: rerun `npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest`, then restart OpenCode
- Config looks wrong: run `opencode debug config` and confirm `"plugin": ["oc-codex-multi-auth"]`
- OAuth callback fails: free port `1455`, then rerun `opencode auth login`
- Browser launch is blocked: use the remote/headless login path from [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md#remote-or-headless-login)
- Wrong account is selected: run `codex-list`, then `codex-switch`
- Account pool looks unhealthy: run `codex-health format="json"` and `codex-doctor deep=true format="json"`
- Import/export feels risky: run `codex-import path="..." dryRun=true` before applying
- Debugging model fallback: enable `ENABLE_PLUGIN_REQUEST_LOGGING=1` and inspect `~/.opencode/logs/codex-plugin/`
