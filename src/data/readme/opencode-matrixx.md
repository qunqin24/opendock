## What is Matrixx?

OpenCode is a powerful open-source AI coding agent. Matrixx makes it **smarter**.

Instead of one model doing everything, Matrixx coordinates a **team of specialists** — each model doing what it does best, in parallel, with full context awareness. The right model for the right job, automatically.

```
You: "Add OAuth2 with PKCE to the API"
     ↓
Morpheus (Claude Opus)     → Plans the implementation
  ├─ Keymaker (GPT 5.3)    → Builds auth middleware + routes
  ├─ Oracle (Claude Sonnet 4.6)  → Reviews architecture in parallel
  └─ Sentinel (Sonnet 4.6) → Audits for security vulnerabilities
     ↓
     Done. Tested. Secure.
```

---

## Why Matrixx?

| Problem | Matrixx Solution |
|---------|------------------|
| One model does everything poorly | **14 specialists** — right model for the right job |
| Agent forgets what it was doing | **Todo Continuation** — forces completion, no exceptions |
| Slow sequential tool calls | **Parallel background agents** — 5+ running simultaneously |
| AI-generated code looks like AI | **Comment Checker** — code indistinguishable from human-written |
| Context window fills up fast | **Aggressive delegation** — subagents carry the load |
| Fragile refactoring | **LSP + AST-Grep** — deterministic, safe, surgical |

---

## The Magic Word

**Don't want to read docs? Just type `ultrawork` (or `ulw`) in your prompt.**

That's it. Parallel agents, background tasks, deep exploration, relentless execution until completion. The agent figures out the rest.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** 1.4.0 — `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
- **OpenCode** ≥ 1.0.150 — https://opencode.ai/docs
- Verify: `bun --version && opencode --version`

### Install (Recommended)

```bash
bunx opencode-matrixx install
```

Or for non-interactive setup (CI/agents):

```bash
bunx opencode-matrixx install --no-tui --claude=yes --openai=yes --gemini=no --copilot=no
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
bunx opencode-matrixx doctor
# No "fail" = good. "warn" for missing optional providers is expected.
# If doctor reports auth failures after login, update to latest: bunx opencode-matrixx@latest doctor
```

Troubleshooting installation issues? See [Installation guide →](docs/guide/installation.md#troubleshooting).

### Configure

Create `matrixx.jsonc` in your project root:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klpanagi/opencode-matrixx/refs/heads/dev/dist/matrixx.schema.json",
  "agents": {}
}
```

### Authenticate

```bash
opencode auth login   # follow prompts for each provider you have
bunx opencode-matrixx doctor --category authentication  # verify
```

### Use

Open OpenCode and start coding. Matrixx activates automatically.

**For LLM agents** — paste this into Claude Code, AmpCode, Cursor, or any LLM agent:

```
Install and configure matrixx by following the instructions here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klpanagi/opencode-matrixx/refs/heads/dev/docs/guide/installation.md

## Software Development Pipeline

Matrixx includes a structured **6-phase development pipeline** that coordinates specialized roles through PLAN → BUILD → VERIFY → REVIEW → SECURE → SHIP. Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria and is enforced by dedicated agents.

### Team Roles

| Role | Agent | Skills | Purpose |
|------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Architect** | Oracle (Claude Opus) | — | System design, architecture decisions, task breakdown |
| **Developer** | Source category | `git-master`, `tdd-enforcer` | Implementation code with TDD |
| **Tester** | Source category | `tdd-enforcer`, `quality-gate` | Test authoring, coverage, verification |
| **Quality Evaluator** | Red-pill category | `quality-gate`, `review-work` | Lint, typecheck, 5-agent code review |
| **Security Expert** | Sentinel (Claude Opus) | `security-core`, `security-sast`, `security-api`, `security-dependencies` | Vulnerability scanning, CVE checks |

### Pipeline Phases

| **Security-related** | Any | Always includes SECURE |

Load the `software-dev` skill to activate the pipeline. The orchestrator automatically selects the right roles and phases based on task scope.

---

## Security

Matrixx includes a three-tier security layer: reactive hooks, configurable policies, and a dedicated security auditing agent.

### Enforcement Hooks

Built-in hooks protect against accidental secret exposure — no setup required.

| Hook | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Secret Leak Guard** | Intercepts `git commit` and `git push`, runs [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) on staged changes, and **blocks the operation** if secrets are detected. |
| **Env File Write Guard** | Blocks agents from writing to sensitive files (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `credentials.json`, `id_rsa`, and 16 other patterns). |

Both hooks are **enabled by default** and run before all other hooks in the execution pipeline. Configure via `matrixx.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "security": {
    "secret_scanning": { "enabled": true, "block_on_detection": true },
    "env_file_guard": { "enabled": true, "allowed_paths": [".env.example"] }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Secret scanning requires [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) installed in your PATH. Without it, the hook silently degrades.

### Sentinel — Security Auditing Agent

**Sentinel** is a read-only security specialist with 9 composable skills covering the full application security stack:

| Skill | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| `security-core` | OWASP Top 10, CWE classification, threat modeling (STRIDE) |
| `security-secrets` | Secret detection, credential scanning, pre-commit hooks |
| `security-sast` | Static analysis, code vulnerability patterns, taint tracking |
| `security-dast` | Dynamic analysis, runtime testing, fuzzing, penetration testing |
| `security-dependencies` | CVE scanning, SBOM generation, supply chain security |
| `security-api` | Authentication, authorization, CORS/CSRF, input validation |
| `security-crypto` | Encryption audit, key management, TLS, password hashing |
| `security-infra` | Container scanning, Dockerfile hardening, IaC audit, K8s security |
| `security-review` | Structured audit reports, severity classification, remediation guidance |

Sentinel never modifies code — it reports findings with CWE IDs, exact locations, and actionable remediation. Any agent can load individual security skills via `load_skills`.

## RTK Integration — Token Compression

Matrixx integrates [RTK](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk) for automatic bash command compression, reducing LLM token consumption by **60-90%** on tool outputs.

### What is RTK?

RTK is a Rust CLI binary that intelligently rewrites bash commands to compress their output before it reaches the LLM. It recognizes 70+ command patterns (git, npm, cargo, test runners, linters, build tools) and applies smart filtering, grouping, and deduplication strategies.

```
# Without RTK: 2000 tokens
$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   src/config.ts
  modified:   src/hooks/index.ts
  ... (50 more lines)

# With RTK: 200 tokens
$ rtk git status
2 files changed: src/config.ts, src/hooks/index.ts
```

### How It Works

The RTK hook intercepts bash commands **before execution** and rewrites them to use RTK's compression:

1. LLM requests: `git status`
2. RTK hook rewrites to: `rtk git status`
3. RTK binary executes and compresses output
4. Compressed output (60-90% smaller) reaches the LLM

The hook runs **silently** — no configuration needed beyond enabling it. RTK's pattern matching handles the rest.

### Configuration

RTK is **disabled by default** (opt-in). Enable it in `matrixx.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "rtk": {
    "enabled": true,
    "binary_path": "/usr/local/bin/rtk",  // optional — defaults to "rtk" in PATH
    "timeout_ms": 5000                     // optional — subprocess timeout
  }
}
```

### Installation

Install RTK from [rtk-ai/rtk](https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk):

```bash
# macOS
brew install rtk-ai/tap/rtk

# Linux (curl)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtk-ai/rtk/main/install.sh | bash

# Verify installation
rtk --version
```

### Performance Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Overhead** | ~10-20ms per bash command |
| **Token savings** | 60-90% reduction on compressed commands |
| **Net benefit** | Significant for projects with frequent bash commands |

The 10-20ms subprocess overhead is negligible compared to command execution time and LLM context savings.

## Headroom Integration — Network-Proxy Compression

> **Deep dive:** [Context Management → 2.4 Headroom](docs/context-management.md#24-headroom--network-proxy-compression) — full 5-layer guide with config reference, verification and troubleshooting.

Matrixx integrates [Headroom](https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/headroom) for network-proxy-level token compression, reducing context by **60-95%** on JSON, **15-20%** on coding agents via `CacheAligner→ContentRouter→CCR` pipeline.

### What is Headroom?

Headroom is a proxy + MCP provider that compresses history before it reaches the LLM. It intercepts the OpenAI-compatible provider `headroom` via `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` and serves retrieval via `headroom_retrieve`.

```
# Without headroom: 50k tokens history
# Every turn ships full JSON + tool outputs

# With headroom wrap: 8k tokens (CCR + retrieval)
$ headroom wrap opencode
# CCR compresses; agents retrieve via headroom_retrieve on demand
```

Headroom is ideal for JSON-heavy sessions, long histories, and multi-project reuse where the same compressed context (CCR) can be shared.

### How It Works

1. User runs `headroom wrap opencode` (starts proxy at `http://127.0.0.1:8787`)
2. Headroom MCP registers `headroom_retrieve` / `headroom_stats`
3. Matrixx detects `hasHeadroom = availableTools.some(t => t.name.startsWith("headroom_"))` and injects Headroom discipline into agent prompts
4. Proxy's `CacheAligner→ContentRouter→CCR` compresses; agents retrieve via `headroom_retrieve` on demand

Matrixx does not vendor Headroom. It provides a thin config bridge in `src/config/schema/headroom.ts` plus runtime detection. Native transport `headroom-opencode` is deferred to Phase 2.

### Configuration

Headroom is **disabled by default** (opt-in). Enable it in `matrixx.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/klpanagi/opencode-matrixx/refs/heads/dev/dist/matrixx.schema.json",
  "headroom": {
    "enabled": true,                        // default: false — opt-in
    "proxyUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8787",     // optional — defaults to proxy default
    "project": "my-project",                // optional — CCR scoping
    "backend": "openai"                     // optional — HEADROOM_BACKEND
  }
}
```

| Option | Type | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Opt-in — no proxy/discipline unless `true` |
| `proxyUrl` | string (url) | `http://127.0.0.1:8787` | Proxy URL (`HEADROOM_PROXY_URL` override) |
| `project` | string | `undefined` | CCR scoping per project |
| `backend` | string | `undefined` | Maps to `HEADROOM_BACKEND` |

### Installation

Install Headroom from [headroomlabs-ai/headroom](https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/headroom):

```bash
# Install (pick one)
uv tool install headroom-ai[all]
# or
pipx install headroom-ai[all]

# Verify
headroom --version
headroom doctor

# Run via proxy (recommended)
headroom wrap opencode
# alternative — env wrapping
# HEADROOM_WRAP=1 headroom wrap -- opencode

# Dashboard
headroom dashboard
```

Package versions: `npm: headroom-ai@0.37.0`, `PyPI: headroom-ai[all]`. Docs at [headroom-docs.vercel.app](https://headroom-docs.vercel.app).

> **Note:** Native TypeScript plugin `headroom-opencode` is deferred to **Phase 2** due to [#2798](https://github.com/sst/opencode/issues/2798) global `fetch` patch collision and [#76](https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/headroom/issues/76) compaction not yet stable. Prefer `wrap` for now.

### Verification

After install, confirm Matrixx sees Headroom:

```bash
headroom doctor          # proxy health
headroom wrap opencode # should show: proxy http://127.0.0.1:8787
```

- In OpenCode TUI, run `headroom_stats` (or `headroom dashboard`) — if the tool is listed, Matrixx injected Headroom discipline into Morpheus/Keymaker prompts.
- Agents will use `headroom_retrieve` / `headroom_search` automatically — you don't call them manually. If `headroom_*` tools are absent, check `matrixx.jsonc` has `headroom.enabled: true` and restart OpenCode.

### Usage

No code changes needed. Once `headroom wrap opencode` is running and `headroom.enabled: true`:

- **You** keep using OpenCode normally (`ultrawork`, etc.).
- **Proxy** compresses history out-of-process via `CacheAligner→ContentRouter→CCR` before it reaches the LLM.
- **Agents** retrieve compressed slices on demand via `headroom_retrieve` (never re-read full history) and check stats via `headroom_stats`.
- **CCR** is shared across projects — ideal for repeated JSON-heavy sessions.

To disable, set `headroom.enabled: false` or run OpenCode without `headroom wrap`.

### Performance Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Matrixx bridge overhead** | ~0ms (prompt-only; proxy out-of-process) |
| **Proxy token savings** | 60-95% JSON, 15-20% coding agents |
| **Complementarity** | L4 orthogonal to L1 RTK + L2 context-mode + L3 DCP + L0 native (zero overlap) |
| **Net benefit** | Retrieval-on-demand reduces per-turn context; CCR shared across projects |

### 5-Layer Complementarity

| Layer | Owner | Mechanism | Reduction |
|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| L0 Native | Matrixx | 70% warn, preemptive-compaction, anthropic-recovery | Prevents OOM |
| L1 RTK | RTK hook | Bash output compression | 60-90% bash |
| L2 context-mode | context-mode plugin | FTS5 sandbox `ctx_*` | 98% sandbox |
| L3 DCP | `@tarquinen/opencode-dcp` | Pruning tiers `economy→ultimate` | Tiered pruning |
| L4 Headroom | headroom proxy | `CacheAligner→ContentRouter→CCR` | 60-95% JSON |
