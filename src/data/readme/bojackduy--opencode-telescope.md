# opencode-telescope

OpenCode TUI plugin for fast keyword search across local conversation history, session transcripts, and past AI coding chats.

Install the npm package `@bojackduy/opencode-telescope` to grep OpenCode chat history, find old code snippets, scope searches to user asks / assistant replies / thoughts / patches, and jump back to any session instantly.

> Inspired by [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) — a fuzzy finder for your conversation history.

## Use cases

- **"I know I discussed this somewhere"** — grep all your sessions by keyword
- **"What did I ask about auth caching?"** — scope search to only your prompts with `user:auth caching`
- **"Find that code snippet"** — search for code you saw in a past LLM response
- **"Find that patch"** — scope search to edits and patches with `patch:validateForSubmit`
- **"Revisit a decision"** — find the conversation where you chose approach X
- **"Session journal"** — browse your entire conversation history like a timeline

## Features

- **Fuzzy grep** — fast sidecar FTS search across your prompts and assistant replies
- **Scoped queries** — opt into noisier fields with `thought:`, `patch:`, or `tool:name`, or narrow with `user:` and `assistant:`
- **Semantic memory search** — optional opt-in local vector search with `llama-server` embeddings and `sqlite-vec`
- **Live preview** — preview the matched conversation result before opening
- **Find & jump** — select any result and jump straight to that session
- **Neovim Telescope-style UX** — familiar `<leader>f` keybind and `/telescope` command
- **Local-first search** — reads your OpenCode session database without sending chat history to a remote service

## Installation

Install from npm as `@bojackduy/opencode-telescope`.

Add the plugin to your `tui.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": ["@bojackduy/opencode-telescope"],
}
```

> To use it from a local clone:
>
> ```jsonc
> "plugin": ["./path/to/opencode-telescope"]
> ```

## Usage

| Action           | Key / Command                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Open search      | `<leader>f` or `/telescope`                     |
| Type to filter   | Fuzzy match against conversation text           |
| Navigate results | `↑` / `↓` or `j` / `k`                          |
| Preview          | Select a result to see the conversation preview |
| Open             | Press `Enter` to jump to the selected session   |
| Owner filter     | Press `o` to cycle `all` / `you` / `assistant`  |

## Scoped Search Queries

Telescope defaults to fast keyword search across user prompts and assistant replies only. Thoughts, patches, file names inside patches, and tool output are intentionally excluded from bare search so normal typing stays low-noise. Add a scope prefix when you want those fields:

| Query | Searches |
| --- | --- |
| `user:timeout` | Your prompts only |
| `assistant:timeout` | Assistant replies only |
| `thought:indexing` | Assistant reasoning/thought parts |
| `patch:SearchResponse` | Code edits from `apply_patch`, `edit`, and `write` tools |
| `in:patch SEARCH_WORKER_TIMEOUT_MS` | Same as `patch:...`, useful when you prefer `in:<scope>` |
| `tool:apply_patch SearchResponse` | A specific tool's indexed content |
| `timeout patch:SearchResponse` | One-line OR search: bare conversation text for `timeout` or patches for `SearchResponse` |
| `user:auth patch:SearchResponse` | One-line OR search across mutually exclusive scopes |
| `patch:"SearchResponse kind"` | Quoted scoped search value with spaces |
| `text:patch:SearchResponse` | Literal conversation text that looks like scope syntax |
| `\patch:SearchResponse` | Same literal search using a leading backslash escape |

Scoped queries highlight only the searched term, so `patch:SearchResponse` highlights `SearchResponse`, not the `patch:` prefix. Multiple one-line clauses use OR, which keeps mixed scopes useful because one indexed row cannot be both `user` and `patch`. Explicit scopes override the owner filter.

## Semantic Search

Semantic search is optional and opt-in. Keyword and scoped search work out of the box; set `OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_ENABLE_VECTOR=1` to enable the local vector path.

The semantic path stays local-first:

- OpenCode's SQLite database is opened read-only.
- Derived keyword and vector indexes are stored in Telescope's sidecar database.
- Keyword updates are incremental: Telescope serves the last-good index while new conversation parts synchronize in small background batches.
- Search and preview workers stay warm across picker openings; keyboard navigation never performs SQLite work directly.
- Embeddings are generated through your local `llama-server` endpoint.
- If embeddings or `sqlite-vec` are unavailable, Telescope falls back to keyword search.

Quick setup:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/share/opencode-telescope/models"

huggingface-cli download \
  nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text-v1.5-GGUF \
  nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf \
  --local-dir "$HOME/.local/share/opencode-telescope/models" \
  --local-dir-use-symlinks false

llama-server \
  -m "$HOME/.local/share/opencode-telescope/models/nomic-embed-text-v1.5.f16.gguf" \
  --embedding \
  --pooling mean \
  -c 8192 \
  -ub 8192 \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8081
```

Then launch OpenCode with `OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_ENABLE_VECTOR=1`. Telescope uses `http://127.0.0.1:8081` by default and will rebuild the vector sidecar from your local session history.

Useful environment variables:

```bash
OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_EMBED_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8081
OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text-v1.5
OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_HYBRID_ALPHA=0.45
OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_ENABLE_VECTOR=1
OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_DISABLE_VECTOR=1
OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_SQLITE_LIB=/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlite/lib/libsqlite3.dylib
OPENCODE_TELESCOPE_SQLITE_VEC_EXT=/path/to/vec0
```

See the full tutorial in [`docs/semantic-search.md`](./docs/semantic-search.md).

## Configuration

Telescope reads optional plugin-specific config from:

```txt
~/.config/opencode/opencode-telescope/config.json
```

If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set, the path is:

```txt
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/opencode-telescope/config.json
```

Missing config, invalid JSON, and invalid individual fields are ignored. Defaults are kept for anything not configured.

Example:

```jsonc
{
  "openKey": "<leader>f",
  "keys": {
    "moveDown": ["down", "j"],
    "moveUp": ["up", "k"],
    "scrollPreviewDown": ["d"],
    "scrollPreviewUp": ["u"],
    "open": ["enter", "return"],
    "close": ["q", "escape"],
    "insertMode": ["/"],
    "normalMode": ["ctrl+q"],
    "toggleOwner": ["o"]
  }
}
```

Key strings support simple names like `j`, `k`, `down`, `up`, `enter`, `return`, and `escape`, plus modifier strings like `ctrl+q`.

## How it works

Reads the OpenCode local SQLite session database in read-only mode, parses conversations into searchable text, builds a Telescope-owned sidecar index, and opens the selected session through the existing TUI route. Optional semantic search adds local embeddings and `sqlite-vec` vector retrieval on top of the same sidecar.
