An [opencode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that gives sessions meaningful names, once, right after the first user message — and never touches them again.

## How it works

- If the **first user message references a GitHub pull request**, the plugin fetches the PR title and branch via the [`gh`](https://cli.github.com) CLI and names the session after it: the repo name exactly as it appears in the URL, the PR number, the PR title. If the branch or title contains an issue key (e.g. `AG-123`), it is included. The link is detected anywhere in the message — a full URL with any suffix (`…/pull/N/changes`, `#diff…`, `?…`) or the short `owner/repo#N` form. Short forms are verified against `gh` and dropped when the repo can't be confirmed — `src/rename.ts#42` is a file reference, not a PR — so unlike full URLs (which degrade to URL-only naming) a short form without `gh` never names the session. When no link-shaped text is found and `prLinkLlm` is on, a small model is asked which PR the message references. Only `github.com` hosts are accepted — a host from an untrusted message is never forwarded to `gh` (see Security).
- Otherwise, for sessions inside a **git project**, the current auto-title gets a project prefix. The label is the project directory name exactly as written on disk (`AdGuardFiltersStats`, not `ad guard filters stats`). Issue keys are picked up from the branch name. When the built-in title has not settled yet (session title still "New session"), the descriptive part is derived from the first line of the user message.
- **Worktrees are detected generically**: a linked worktree has a `.git` *file* pointing into the main repo, so the project label is the main repo directory name and the issue key comes from the worktree branch — no configuration needed, works with any directory layout.
- Sessions in scratch directories (temp dirs, OpenChamber chat workspaces) keep the plain auto-title; the project-naming path skips them. A first message that references a PR is still named by the PR.
- Sub-agent sessions are skipped.

## Safety rules

- **Renames exactly once per session** (tracked in a state file, survives restarts). Later manual renames are never overridden.
- **A manual/external title is never replaced.** The plugin tracks title-change events: the first title set right after the first user message is assumed to be opencode's auto-title and may be replaced; any other title marks the session as foreign.
- The rename fires ~10s after the first user message (falling back to the first `session.idle` for sessions restored before the plugin saw them). If a title recorded as the built-in auto-title is written again over ours before the first idle, our title is re-applied exactly once; a change from any other source — including a manual rename — wins immediately and closes that correction window. After the first idle, later changes are never touched.
- No LLM calls by default; naming is deterministic. Failures never break the session — the plugin just logs and moves on.

On V2, a restored session may expose only history after compaction. When
its original first user message is unavailable, the plugin leaves that old
session unchanged and logs the reason. A summary or later message is never
used as a substitute. New sessions retain normal automatic naming.

Pending naming is cancelled when a session is deleted or the plugin is
unloaded. A title whose auto-title provenance was not observed remains
protected; the existing early-manual-title ambiguity is unchanged.

Transient ownership and replay caches retain at most 1,024 recent sessions
per plugin instance. Retained rename history still uses the existing state
file and 30-day retention.

## Install

One package supports both host generations automatically. Verified with
OpenCode V1 **1.18.27**, V1 **1.18.32** and V2 **2.0.14**. Existing V1 users
can keep their host version, settings and registration; there is no
compatibility-mode setting.

### OpenCode V1

From npm:

```jsonc
// ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
{
  "plugin": ["@maximtop/opencode-session-namer"]
}
```

Or from a local checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/maximtop/opencode-session-namer
cd opencode-session-namer
pnpm install
ln -s "$PWD/src/index.ts" ~/.config/opencode/plugins/session-namer.ts
```

Restart opencode / OpenChamber to load the plugin.

### OpenCode V2

Use V2's native `plugins` setting:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@maximtop/opencode-session-namer"]
}
```

For a local checkout, run `pnpm install` there and register the absolute
**directory** containing the server entry, for example:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["/absolute/path/opencode-session-namer/src"]
}
```

V2 selects `server.ts` inside that directory. It requires a directory in
this setting, not the path to an individual TypeScript file. Keep only one
registration: either the package or the checkout.

Restart V2 and let it finish installing/loading configured plugins before
starting a new chat. The V1 and V2 configuration keys are host conventions;
the package itself selects the correct integration automatically.

## Configuration

All optional; create `~/.config/opencode/session-namer.json` to override:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `template` | `[{project}] {agKey} {title}` | Name shape. Slots: `{project}`, `{agKey}`, `{title}`. Empty slots collapse. An empty string falls back to the default. |
| `prPrefix` | `Review pull/{number} ` | Prepended to `{title}` for PR sessions. `{number}` is the PR number. Empty string disables the prefix. |
| `agKeyPattern` | `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{1,9}-\d+` | Regex for the issue key; an optional capture group selects the key. An empty string falls back to the default. |
| `maxLength` | `90` | Titles longer than this get shortened. |
| `smartShorten` | `false` | Shorten overlong titles with an LLM instead of a hard word-cut. |
| `smartShortenModel` | `null` | `provider/model` for both model helpers; otherwise V1 uses `small_model`/host default and V2 uses the host default. |
| `prLinkLlm` | `false` | When no PR link is found in the first message, ask a tool-free model helper which GitHub PR it references; the reply is validated before use. |
| `renameDelayMs` | `10000` | Delay after the first user message (or first idle) before renaming. |

### Environment overrides

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `SESSION_NAMER_CONFIG` | Config file path instead of `~/.config/opencode/session-namer.json`. |
| `SESSION_NAMER_STATE` | State file path (rename-once bookkeeping). Entries older than 30 days are pruned on every write. |
| `SESSION_NAMER_DELAY_MS` | Overrides `renameDelayMs` (positive integer of milliseconds; `0`, negatives and non-integers fall back to the default). |

### smartShorten

When enabled, only an overlong descriptive part is shortened; the structural
prefix (`[project] AG-123 Review pull/N`) stays intact. On failure, the plugin
falls back to word truncation.

Both optional helpers (`smartShorten`, `prLinkLlm`) respect an explicit
`smartShortenModel`. Otherwise V1 uses its configured `small_model`, falling
back to the host default, and V2 uses the host default. V1 creates a temporary
child session with tools disabled and attempts deletion after success or
failure. V2 uses standalone text generation without tools or a persistent
helper session. Default naming makes no plugin-initiated model calls.

If V1 cannot read its model configuration, helpers use the host default.
Task instructions remain outside the encoded source text on both hosts.

## Security

- PR-like URLs on other hosts are ignored by both deterministic parsing and
  model-assisted extraction.
- Only `github.com` PR links are fetched. Hosts from untrusted messages are
  never passed to `gh`: `gh` forwards GitHub Enterprise tokens to whatever
  host `GH_HOST` names, so doing so would have exfiltrated the user's tokens
  to an attacker-controlled host. Enterprise hosts are simply not supported.
- Titles are sanitized of C0/C1 control characters and Unicode format
  characters (bidi overrides, zero-width) before `session.update`, so a
  crafted PR title or model reply can neither inject terminal sequences nor
  spoof how the title displays.
- Model helpers have no tools: V1 uses a tool-disabled child session, while
  V2 uses standalone text generation. Fixed instructions treat source text
  as data; V2 encodes that text as a JSON string in the prompt. Inferred PR
  links are accepted only for `github.com`.
- The plugin never logs tokens or other secrets.

## Requirements

- PR titles require the `gh` CLI, authenticated (`gh auth login`). Without it, PR sessions are named from the URL alone: `[compiler] Review pull/386`.
- Everything else works with no external tools.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
make check   # lint + type-check + tests
```

The Vitest suite exercises both host adapters and the shared lifecycle;
PR cases make real `gh` calls and need `gh auth login`. Package compatibility
also requires isolated real-host acceptance runs; see DEPLOYMENT.md. Never
replace a working V1 installation with V2 just to test the plugin.
