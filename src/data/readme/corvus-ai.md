## About Corvus

> *In Norse mythology, Odin's ravens Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory) fly across the world each day, gathering information and reporting back. Corvus works the same way — sending specialized agents out to research, explore, implement, and validate, then synthesizing their findings into a coherent whole.*

## What Corvus Does

One agent to drive your entire workflow. Describe what you need, and Corvus handles the rest — clarifying requirements, exploring the codebase, planning, implementing, testing, and validating.

- **Single point of entry** — no need to pick the right agent or remember who does what
- **Adaptive planning depth** — automatically scales from zero-ceremony quick fixes to spec-driven workflows based on task complexity
- **Full lifecycle management** — from requirements through implementation to validation
- **Context across phases** — maintains coherence across a complex, multi-step task
- **Quality gates at every boundary** — objective and subjective validation before moving on

### Usage

Have a complex task in mind? Tell `@corvus` what you need. It handles clarification, planning, implementation, and validation automatically — scaling its process to match the task:

```
@corvus fix the typo in the footer              # no plan — direct delegation
@corvus add a dark mode toggle with tests        # lightweight plan — minimal ceremony
@corvus refactor the payment module to use the new API  # standard plan — full workflow
@corvus redesign the plugin architecture         # spec-driven — formal specs + full workflow
```

Need something quick? Talk to `@corvus` directly, it'll know which specialists to involve:

```
@corvus find all auth files
@corvus review the login endpoint
@corvus how does JWT refresh rotation work?
```

---

## Installation

### Plugin Install (Recommended)

```bash
npx corvus-ai
# or for a global install
npx corvus-ai --global
```

This adds `corvus-ai@latest` to your OpenCode plugin config. All agents, commands, and skills are loaded automatically. Corvus contributes defaults; your existing agent and command configuration is merged last and remains authoritative.

### Manual Install

Clone the repo and symlink the three product directories into your OpenCode config. Use this form only when the destination directories do not already exist; otherwise inspect and merge individual entries so existing configuration is not replaced.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NachoFLizaur/corvus.git
cd corvus

ln -s "$(pwd)/agent" ~/.config/opencode/agent
ln -s "$(pwd)/command" ~/.config/opencode/command
ln -s "$(pwd)/skill" ~/.config/opencode/skill
```

Or copy instead of symlinking:

```bash
cp -r agent/ ~/.config/opencode/agent/
cp -r command/ ~/.config/opencode/command/
cp -r skill/ ~/.config/opencode/skill/
```

Manual installs expose agent frontmatter directly to OpenCode, so the native singular `permission` field is required. Corvus's plugin loader still accepts legacy `permissions` metadata when `permission` is absent, but that read-compatibility path is not the canonical format and should not be used for new or manually installed agents.

### Configuration Precedence

Corvus registration follows these rules:

- **Agents and commands are user-last**: Corvus defaults are loaded first, then the pre-existing user record is recursively merged over them. Nested user values win; user arrays, scalars, and `null` replace defaults; user-only and unknown native fields remain available. An `undefined` user value is treated as absent.
- **MCP collisions are preserved exactly**: if the user configuration already has its own `mcp["web-research"]` property, Corvus does not merge, replace, or mutate that value. Only when the property is absent does Corvus add the local default with `command: ["npx", "-y", "web-research-mcp@0.1.0"]`.
- **Skill registration is idempotent**: the resolved absolute Corvus skill directory is appended to `skills.paths` only when that exact path is not already present. Existing entries and their order are preserved.

These rules apply to the OpenCode configuration passed to the plugin hook. A repository-local `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` is user-local state, not a Corvus package input or a source of plugin defaults.

### Customizing Models

Corvus agents work with whichever model you've set up as default in opencode, but you can assign specific models per agent in your OpenCode config if you wish to:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["corvus-ai"],
  "agent": {
    "corvus": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4"
    },
    "code-implementer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
    },
    "code-explorer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4"
    }
  }
}
```

Any agent field (`model`, `temperature`, `permission`, etc.) can be overridden this way. Your config is the user-last layer, while omitted Corvus defaults remain available.

## How Corvus Works

Under the hood, Corvus follows a structured multi-phase workflow:

```
User Request
    │
    ├─── spec-complete ──► skip 0a/0b ──► Plan Input
    ▼
Phase 0a: Requirements Clarification (@requirements-analyst)
    │
    ├─── QUESTIONS_NEEDED ──► Corvus presents one batch ──► Phase 0a
    ├─── DISCOVERY_NEEDED ──► Phase 1 ──► Phase 0b POST_DISCOVERY
    │                                      ├── questions/discovery delta ──► Phase 0b
    │                                      └── clear ──────────────────────┐
    └─── CLEAR ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
                                                                           ▼
Plan Input (consume preselection; otherwise interactive choice/auto heuristic)
    │
    ├─── No Plan ────────► Direct delegation (single task, done)
    └─── Lightweight / Standard / Spec-Driven
              │
              └──► Test Input (consume supplied flags; ask/default only missing values)
    │
    ▼
Phase 2: Planning (@task-planner creates MASTER_PLAN.md + CONTEXT.md)
    │
    ▼
Phase 3: User Approval (single approval gate)
    │
    ▼
User Choice: "Start Implementation" → Phase 4
             "High Accuracy Review" → Phase 3.5
    │
    ▼
Phase 3.5: Plan Review (@plan-reviewer) [optional]
    │   OKAY → user confirms → Phase 4
    │   REJECT → @task-planner fixes → User chooses: re-review or proceed
    │
    ▼
Phase 4: Implementation Loop (per-PHASE, not per-task)
    │   4a: @code-implementer (workstreams of phase tasks, parallel when file sets are disjoint)
    │   4b: @code-quality (entire phase, phase-targeted tests, with failure attribution; risk-triaged when acceptance-only)
    │       FAIL → fix (iteration 1: direct; iteration ≥2: FAILURE_ANALYSIS first) → revalidate
    │   4c: @task-planner PROGRESS_UPDATE → verify plan-only diff → next phase
    │
    ▼
Phase 5: Final Validation
    │   5a: @code-quality (objective PASS / FAIL — the single full-suite run; a Lightweight non-deferred plan takes this run at its final 4b gate)
    │   5b: @ux-dx-quality (PASS / NEEDS_IMPROVEMENT / CRITICAL_ISSUES, when flagged)
    │
    ▼
Phase 6: Completion
    │   @task-planner SUCCESS_EXTRACTION (feature-wide, once)
```

Key features:
- **Adaptive plan-type selection**: Scores task complexity across 6 dimensions, recommends one of 4 tiers (No Plan → Lightweight → Standard → Spec-Driven), user can override
- **Test preference**: Choose tests at every quality gate, deferred to final validation only, or skipped entirely (`@corvus-auto` always defers tests to Phase 5)
- **Predictable test cadence**: Every dispatch carries `test_scope: targeted | full | none` — phase-targeted runs at each 4b gate (when not deferred), then THE single full-suite run at Phase 5a for all test-enabled modes (a Lightweight non-deferred plan carries this run at its final 4b gate)
- **Phase-level validation**: Quality checks run once per phase, not per task
- **Workstream dispatch**: One code-implementer per workstream (1-5 dependency-ordered tasks); workstreams with disjoint file sets run in parallel
- **Cross-session resume**: An in-progress MASTER_PLAN is detected at intake and resumed at the first incomplete step (`@corvus` asks first; `@corvus-auto` decides deterministically)
- **Conditional clarification**: Phase 0b skipped when requirements are already clear
- **Conditional requirements analysis + risk-triaged gates**: spec-complete requests skip Phase 0a; acceptance-only 4b gates may be triage-skipped with lightweight verification (non-deferred gates always run)
- **Two-tier quality gates**: Objective (@code-quality) at phase boundaries + Subjective (@ux-dx-quality) at feature completion
- **Failure attribution**: Quality gate identifies exactly which task(s) failed
- **Learning loops**: Repeated gate failures (iteration ≥2) get FAILURE_ANALYSIS before the next fix; Phase 6 alone extracts feature-wide success learnings, distilled to the local-only `.corvus/tasks/learnings.md`
- **Optional plan review**: Phase 3.5 validates plan quality before implementation begins
- **Safe autonomous completion**: `@corvus-auto` finishes locally by default; Git delivery requires an explicit trusted opt-in and guarded single-commit route

## Corvus PR Review

Corvus PR Review is a multi-pass code review system that brings the same structured, multi-agent approach to pull request reviews. It runs two detection children in parallel — a holistic reviewer and a dedicated security reviewer — synthesizes their dimension-tagged findings, and posts formatted reviews to GitHub — either interactively with user gates or fully autonomously.

### When to Use

- You want a thorough, structured review that goes beyond surface-level linting
- You need security-focused analysis with OWASP/CWE knowledge
- You want consistent review quality across your team
- You want to preview and edit review comments before posting

### Usage

```
@corvus-review review PR #123
@corvus-review review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
@corvus-review-auto #456    # autonomous; auto-posts only when every rail passes
```

### Workflow

```
User: "Review PR #123"
    │
    ▼
R0: Intake & Triage (parse PR, fetch metadata, load config)
    │
    ▼
R1: Context Gathering [parallel]
    ├── @pr-context-gatherer (files, deps, tests, conventions)
    └── @researcher (issues, CI, advisories)
    │
    ▼
R2: Two-Child Review [parallel]
    ├── Holistic: architecture + correctness + conventions (@pr-code-reviewer, read-only)
    └── Security (@security-reviewer, read-only)
        → dimension-tagged findings fan into four result slots
    │
    ▼
R3: Comment Synthesis (dedup, filter, severity, nit budget)
    │
    ▼
R4: User Gate or deterministic autonomous rails
    │
    ▼
R5: Authorized post via @pr-comment-writer, or local-only completion
```

### Key Features

- **Two parallel review children** — a holistic reviewer covering the architecture, correctness, and conventions dimensions plus a dedicated security reviewer, fanned into four result slots
- **Dedicated security agent** with OWASP Top 10 and CWE knowledge base
- **Aggressive false-positive filtering** with confidence scores and nit budget enforcement
- **Conventional Comments format** for consistent, actionable feedback
- **Trusted configuration** from `.opencode/review-config.yaml` at the PR's verified immutable base SHA, with safe built-in fallback and visible provenance
- **Delta re-reviews** — a hidden review marker records the reviewed commit, so a later run skips resolved findings, verifies prior blockers were addressed, and focuses on what changed; posts pin to the reviewed head SHA (`commit_id`) behind a pre-post drift guard
- **Least-privilege detection** — untrusted PR content is analyzed only by mechanically read-only R2 reviewers; `@code-quality` remains on the implementation-validation path
- **Interactive and autonomous modes** — preview before posting, or let it run hands-free
- **Fail-closed posting** — failed/invalid reviews stay local; eligible posts go only through the structured, command-safe `@pr-comment-writer` boundary
- **Just-in-time context gathering** — no pre-built index needed, works on any repo

### Configuration

```yaml
# .opencode/review-config.yaml at the PR's verified base SHA
severity_threshold: "nitpick"
max_nits: 3
passes:
  architecture: true
  correctness: true
  security: true
  conventions: true
path_rules:
  - pattern: "src/auth/**"
    elevate_security: true
  - pattern: "vendor/**"
    skip_passes: ["conventions"]
```

## Development

The published package keeps `@opencode-ai/plugin` peer compatibility broad (`*`). Contributor installs pin the development SDK baseline to `@opencode-ai/plugin@1.18.3` so local build and type behavior is reproducible without narrowing consumer compatibility.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build
bun run build

# Type check
bun x tsc --noEmit

# Run tests (build first; build.test.ts consumes dist/)
bun test
```

### Safe Local Development

- Treat `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` in a checkout as developer-local OpenCode state. Do not overwrite, copy into the package, commit, or use it as an implicit product input when developing Corvus.
- Product inputs are the checked-in `agent/`, `command/`, and `skill/` prompts plus the plugin source. Manual-install experiments should copy or link only those prompt directories after inspecting the destination.
- Keep local OpenCode configuration changes explicit and separate from source changes. The plugin's user-last merge means local hardening does not need to be copied into Corvus defaults.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not loading** — Verify your OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/config.json` or `.opencode/config.json`) has `"corvus-ai": true` under `plugins`.

**Agents not appearing** — Make sure `bun install` or `npm install` completed successfully. The package must be present in `node_modules` with its `agent/`, `command/`, and `skill/` directories.

**Skills not found** — Skills are loaded from the package's `skill/` directory at runtime. If you used the manual install method, verify your symlinks point to the correct location (`ls -la ~/.config/opencode/skill/`).

**Duplicate agents** — If you have both the plugin install and manual symlinks active, agents may appear twice. Pick one installation method and remove the other.
