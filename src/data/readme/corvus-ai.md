## About Corvus

> *In Norse mythology, Odin's ravens Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory) fly across the world each day, gathering information and reporting back. Corvus works the same way — sending specialized agents out to research, explore, implement, and validate, then synthesizing their findings into a coherent whole.*

## What Corvus Does

One agent to drive your entire workflow. Describe what you need, and Corvus handles the rest — clarifying requirements, exploring the codebase, planning, implementing, testing, and validating.

- **Single point of entry** — no need to pick the right agent or remember who does what
- **Adaptive planning depth** — one model-chosen effort level, from narrow discovery to wider architectural investigation; simple fixes still delegate directly
- **Full lifecycle management** — from requirements through implementation to validation
- **Context across phases** — maintains coherence across a complex, multi-step task
- **Quality gates at every boundary** — objective and subjective validation before moving on

### Usage

Have a complex task in mind? Tell `@corvus` what you need. It handles clarification, planning, implementation, and validation automatically — scaling its process to match the task:

```
@corvus fix the typo in the footer              # no plan — direct delegation
@corvus add a dark mode toggle with tests        # one adaptive plan, deferred tests
@corvus refactor the payment module to use the new API  # reviewed implementation slices
@corvus redesign the plugin architecture         # wider discovery for architectural change
```

Need something quick? Talk to `@corvus` directly, it'll know which specialists to involve:

```
@corvus find all auth files
@corvus review the login endpoint
@corvus how does JWT refresh rotation work?
```

---

## Installation

### Plugin Install (Recommended)

```bash
npx corvus-ai
# or for a global install
npx corvus-ai --global
```

This adds `corvus-ai@latest` to your OpenCode plugin config. All agents, commands, and skills are loaded automatically. Corvus contributes defaults only, and your own settings stay authoritative on both hosts — on OpenCode v1 Corvus merges your agent and command configuration last, and on OpenCode v2 host ordering guarantees it, so Corvus performs no merge at all. See [Configuration Precedence](#configuration-precedence) for the per-host details and [OpenCode v2](#opencode-v2) for v2 installs.

### Manual Install

Clone the repo and symlink the three product directories into your OpenCode config. Use this form only when the destination directories do not already exist; otherwise inspect and merge individual entries so existing configuration is not replaced.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NachoFLizaur/corvus.git
cd corvus

ln -s "$(pwd)/agent" ~/.config/opencode/agent
ln -s "$(pwd)/command" ~/.config/opencode/command
ln -s "$(pwd)/skill" ~/.config/opencode/skill
```

Or copy instead of symlinking:

```bash
cp -r agent/ ~/.config/opencode/agent/
cp -r command/ ~/.config/opencode/command/
cp -r skill/ ~/.config/opencode/skill/
```

Manual installs expose agent frontmatter directly to OpenCode, so the native singular `permission` field is required. Corvus's plugin loader still accepts legacy `permissions` metadata when `permission` is absent, but that read-compatibility path is not the canonical format and should not be used for new or manually installed agents.

These instructions target OpenCode v1's config layout. On OpenCode v2, install the plugin instead — `npx corvus-ai@beta --v2`, or a `plugins` array entry (see [OpenCode v2](#opencode-v2)) — so the same agents, commands, and skills are registered from the package. The `@beta` tag is required while v2 support ships on the `beta` dist-tag, because `latest` has no `--v2` flag; drop it once v2 reaches `latest`.

### OpenCode v2

Corvus ships one package with two entry points: `dist/index.js` remains the legacy OpenCode v1 function entry, while `dist/server.js` serves both OpenCode 1.18.30+ and OpenCode v2 through the `corvus-ai/server` subpath. The shared entry exports `{ id, server, setup }`: v1 invokes the legacy hook function through `server`, and v2 invokes `setup`. Both register the same 16 agents, 4 commands, 18 skills, and the default `web-research` MCP server.

Install with the CLI, which writes the plural `plugins` key into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/opencode.json` (default `~/.config/opencode`):

```bash
npx corvus-ai@beta --v2
```

The `@beta` tag is required while v2 support ships on the `beta` dist-tag: `latest` is the v1-only release and rejects `--v2` with `Unknown option: --v2`. Drop `@beta` once v2 reaches `latest`.

Or add the entry by hand:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["corvus-ai@beta"]
}
```

An existing v1 `plugin` entry is never rewritten for you: keep the singular key for a v1 host and the plural key for v2.

#### Config Key Renames

v2 renamed the configuration keys Corvus interacts with. When you move a machine to v2, rename them in your own config too:

| v1 | v2 | Notes |
|----|----|-------|
| `plugin: []` | `plugins: []` | The host still auto-migrates the singular key |
| `agent: {}` | `agents: {}` | Same record shape, renamed key |
| `command: {}` | `commands: {}` | Same record shape, renamed key |
| `skills.paths: []` | `skills: []` | A flat array of skill directories |
| `mcp.<name>` | `mcp.servers.<name>` | Server records moved one level down |
| `permission: {}` | `permissions: []` | Per-agent rules became an ordered list |

#### Agent Overrides Under v2

Agent fields were renamed with the rest of the v2 schema. Under `agents.<name>`:

| v1 field | v2 field | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| `prompt` | `system` | The instruction body |
| `temperature` | `request.body.temperature` | `request.body` also carries other provider body parameters |
| `permission: {action: effect}` | `permissions: [{action, resource, effect}]` | Ordered rules; the LAST matching rule wins |
| `maxSteps` | `steps` | |
| `disable` | `disabled` | |
| `model` | `model` | Unchanged — still `"provider/model"` |

Permission action names moved to the v2 tool names: `bash` → `shell`, `task` → `subagent`, and both `write` and `patch` → `edit`. Rules you write are appended after Corvus's, and because the last matching rule wins, yours decide — with the single exception described under [Protected Agents Under v2](#protected-agents-under-v2). Six actions in Corvus's own corpus have no v2 tool (`list`, `todowrite`, `todoread`, `codesearch`, `lsp`, `doom_loop`); their rules are translated unchanged and are harmless, because `action` is a free-form string.

#### Skill Name Collisions

Corvus registers skills as records keyed by id, so three packaged ids that lack the `corvus-` prefix can collide with a skill of your own: `deep-research`, `frontend-design`, and `web-search`. Your definition wins by host ordering — user skills load after package plugins — and no configuration is needed. Corvus keeps the plain names rather than renaming them, so a collision replaces the packaged skill instead of shadowing it under a second name.

#### Protected Agents Under v2

All agents default to `permission: { "*": "allow" }`. Only `pr-context-gatherer`, `pr-comment-writer`, `pr-code-reviewer`, and `security-reviewer` deny `edit`/`write`; `corvus-auto` and `corvus-review-auto` deny `question`; `corvus` and `corvus-auto` retain their destructive-bash denies. There are no other frontmatter restrictions. The three protected agents (`pr-code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, and `pr-comment-writer`) retain these v2 guarantees:

- **Edit/write boundary — enforced.** Corvus registers a `permission.hook("evaluate")` that re-applies the authored rules at request time from its own packaged files. The hook can only tighten: the host resolves its own rules first and Corvus never writes `allow`, so a denial cannot be widened by any configuration. Denials name the boundary — for example, `corvus: pr-code-reviewer is mechanically read-only; edit is denied by the plugin's security boundary.` (illustrative wording; the message itself lives with the code).
- **Prompt immutability — demoted to a presence-only guarantee.** v2 has no configuration hook and no agent field that stays out of reach afterwards, so Corvus can no longer guarantee that a protected agent runs its authored prompt unchanged. A `session.hook("context")` re-appends the authored body when no system part carries it, which restores an absent prompt but cannot remove or override instructions supplied elsewhere. Shell permissions now default-allow: read-only review and tool-only posting are prompt obligations, not a shell sandbox. Existing PR/verdict/sync caller checks run inside the tool adapters, independently of frontmatter.

`src/v2/enforce-protected.ts` is the owning location for the rationale, host-source citations, and fail directions; this section summarizes it rather than restating it.

### Configuration Precedence

Your configuration wins on both hosts, by different mechanisms.

**OpenCode v1** — Corvus is handed the resolved config in a plugin hook and merges yours over its defaults:

- **Agents and commands are user-last**: Corvus defaults are loaded first, then the pre-existing user record is recursively merged over them. Nested user values win; user arrays, scalars, and `null` replace defaults; user-only and unknown native fields remain available. An `undefined` user value is treated as absent.
- **MCP collisions are preserved exactly**: if the user configuration already has its own `mcp["web-research"]` property, Corvus does not merge, replace, or mutate that value. Only when the property is absent does Corvus add the local default with `command: ["npx", "-y", "web-research-mcp@0.1.0"]`.
- **Skill registration is idempotent**: the resolved absolute Corvus skill directory is appended to `skills.paths` only when that exact path is not already present. Existing entries and their order are preserved.

**OpenCode v2** — there is no configuration hook. Corvus contributes records through registration transforms, and the host applies your agent, command, and skill configuration afterwards:

- **Agents and commands are user-last by host ordering**: Corvus upserts each agent (assigning only the fields its prompt files declare) and registers each command as a function. Your `agents` and `commands` entries are applied after package plugins, so every field you set wins and your permission rules are appended after Corvus's, where last-match-wins makes them decisive. Corvus runs no merge of its own — see [Protected Agents Under v2](#protected-agents-under-v2) for the one boundary that is re-applied at request time.
- **Skills are keyed records**: a skill of yours sharing an id replaces the packaged one, again by host ordering.
- **MCP collisions are preserved exactly**: the `web-research` default is added only when `mcp.servers["web-research"]` is absent. A present entry is left exactly as it is, even when it is disabled or points elsewhere.

These rules apply to the OpenCode configuration Corvus is given by the host. A repository-local `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` is user-local state, not a Corvus package input or a source of plugin defaults.

For Corvus agents only, the plugin preserves any hook-visible output budget (normally already seeded on v1), otherwise sets the smaller of the model output limit and 32,000 tokens; v2 exposes the agent ID but only a model reference, so it falls back to 32,000 without a model-limit clamp and can replace a larger unobservable route/model generation default.

### Customizing Models

Corvus agents work with whichever model you've set up as default in opencode, but you can assign specific models per agent in your OpenCode config if you wish to.

On OpenCode v1:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["corvus-ai"],
  "agent": {
    "corvus": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4"
    },
    "code-implementer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
    },
    "code-explorer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4"
    }
  }
}
```

The same overrides on OpenCode v2, with the plural keys:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["corvus-ai@beta"],
  "agents": {
    "corvus": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-opus-4"
    },
    "code-implementer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"
    },
    "code-explorer": {
      "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4"
    }
  }
}
```

Any agent field can be overridden this way — `model`, `permission`/`permissions`, `temperature` (`request.body.temperature` on v2), and so on. Your config is the last layer to be applied, while omitted Corvus defaults remain available. The v1 and v2 field names differ: see [Agent Overrides Under v2](#agent-overrides-under-v2).

## How Corvus Works

Simple requests delegate directly to a specialist without a plan. Planned work follows the [phase map](docs/CORVUS-STATE-MACHINE.md); its links lead to the skills that own each procedure.

### One Plan, Adaptive Effort

The model chooses `depth: quick | standard | deep`, recorded as one `**Depth**` line with a reason in `.corvus/tasks/<feature>/PLAN.md`. Quick narrows discovery and plan prose, standard is the default, and deep widens discovery and checks every touched ADR scope. Every depth retains discovery, the review loop, phase gates, and final validation.

<!-- adapted from mattpocock/skills (MIT) -->
The single plan holds immutable user requirements, acceptance criteria, decisions, unknowns, tasks, gates, and history. Tasks are vertical slices with `blocks:` dependencies and observable done-whens. Implementation paths and code snippets stay out of the plan body; exact file ownership is resolved at dispatch and recorded in its Log. See [Plan Format](agent/task-planner.md#plan-format).

### What Corvus commits to your repo

`.corvus/` is committed to your repo by default: `.corvus/tasks/<feature>/**` contains PLAN.md, DISCOVERY.md, ledgers, and task-scoped `reviews/` state as project memory, not scratch. Keep these records with the product diff so the files, changes, and intent remain traceable. Interactive Corvus lists them in its commit handoff; Corvus Auto includes their exact file paths in opted-in Git delivery and otherwise leaves that commit to you. Keeping Corvus's records local is supported only for local reviews, not the planning/implementation workflow; `delivery_mode: local_only` defers Git delivery rather than opting out of committed planning records. The Corvus repository itself is the exception described in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#planning-records).

### From Request to Completion

- **Clarify and discover** — [requirements grilling](skill/corvus-phase-0/SKILL.md) returns question batches; [discovery](skill/corvus-phase-1/SKILL.md) grounds the plan at every depth. A spec-complete request can bypass grilling, not discovery.
- **Plan, review, approve** — [planning and approval](skill/corvus-phase-2/SKILL.md) creates the plan, then runs mandatory Phase 3.5 plan review: `REJECT → PLAN_FIX → whole-plan re-review` until `OK`, without a round cap. Unchanged findings produce `STALLED` and remain unresolved, never OK. The single approval gate offers **Start Implementation** only after OK, **Request Changes**, or **Override Depth**; changes return through planning and review, refreshing discovery as needed.
- **Implement the frontier** — [execution](skill/corvus-phase-4/SKILL.md) works unblocked tasks in the current phase with disjoint parallel file sets. Each phase closes through `4a → 4b → 4c`: implementation, acceptance-only gate, then one batched `PROGRESS_UPDATE`. Failure iteration 1 gets a direct fix; iteration ≥2 gets `FAILURE_ANALYSIS` first; three unsuccessful fix iterations stop execution. Material divergence from the approved plan returns to planning.
- **Validate the feature** — [final validation](skill/corvus-phase-5/SKILL.md) runs objective 5a and, when a task carries `[ux]`, subjective 5b. Blocking findings return to scoped fixes; missing evidence holds completion.
- **Extract and summarize** — [completion](skill/corvus-phase-6/SKILL.md) owns feature-wide `SUCCESS_EXTRACTION`, Corvus-process learnings, and the final summary. [Follow-up triage](skill/corvus-phase-7/SKILL.md) routes subsequent requests while preserving completed history.

### Cross-model plan review (recommended)

Assign different models to `task-planner` and `plan-reviewer` through host configuration, not packaged prompt frontmatter. With neither override set, both use the host default: Phase 0 emits one degraded warning and review proceeds. The gate summary reports `review_mode: same-model` (degraded) or `review_mode: cross-model` for distinct resolved models, without a degraded warning.

On v1, merge these per-agent overrides into `opencode.json`:

```json
{"agent":{"task-planner":{"model":"<provider/model-a>"},"plan-reviewer":{"model":"<provider/model-b>"}}}
```

On v2, use the plural `agents` key in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/opencode.json` (default `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`), the same file that holds `plugins`; see [Agent Overrides Under v2](#agent-overrides-under-v2):

```json
{"agents":{"task-planner":{"model":"<provider/model-a>"},"plan-reviewer":{"model":"<provider/model-b>"}}}
```

### Tests and Resume

`tests: deferred | none` is recorded as `**Tests**` in the plan and defaults to deferred. Deferred authors coverage during implementation but executes no tests before the single full-suite run at Phase 5a. None neither authors nor runs tests. Both use acceptance-only 4b gates and retain final validation; see the authoritative [Tests policy](skill/corvus-phase-2/SKILL.md#tests).

Intake reads PLAN.md's `**Status**` and resumes at the first incomplete step, checking the last gate's evidence. `@corvus` asks before resuming; `@corvus-auto` selects deterministically. Legacy plans are read-only context; resume and follow-up use task-planner's `AMEND_PLAN copy-forward` into a fresh PLAN.md with a DISCOVERY.md companion; completed plans are likewise preserved for follow-ups.

Interactive Corvus uses `question()` for choices and lets the user override depth at approval. Corvus Auto accepts supplied inputs or defaults, records assumptions, auto-approves only OK, and halts on stalled review. It finishes locally by default; [Git delivery](agent/corvus-auto.md#git-delivery) requires trusted opt-in renewed on resume and its guarded delivery checks. Interactive delivery remains a user handoff.

### Decision Records

<!-- adapted from mattpocock/skills (MIT) -->
Architecture decisions belong in the user's repository at [`docs/decisions/`](docs/decisions/README.md) only when all three conditions hold: **hard to reverse**, **surprising without context**, and **the result of a real trade-off**. Otherwise, no ADR is needed. The plan links records by ID, and review checks those whose scope it touches. Accepted decisions change through superseding records; `.corvus/tasks/learnings.md` keeps only Corvus-process learnings.

---

## Corvus PR Review

Corvus PR Review is a multi-pass code review system for pull requests and local changes. It runs two detection children in parallel — Standards (`@pr-code-reviewer`) and Spec plus independent security (`@security-reviewer`) — keeps findings separate by axis through synthesis, and posts formatted PR reviews to GitHub — either interactively with user gates or fully autonomously. LOCAL reviews finish with a saved document and a chat summary, never a post.

### When to Use

- You want a thorough, structured review that goes beyond surface-level linting
- You need security-focused analysis with OWASP/CWE knowledge
- You want consistent review quality across your team
- You want to preview and edit review comments before posting

### Usage

```
@corvus-review review PR #123
@corvus-review review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
@corvus-review-auto #456    # autonomous; posts by default, with limits disclosed
@corvus-review-auto review this PR    # discover the current branch's PR
@corvus-review review my changes      # LOCAL when no PR is found
```

**Intake precedence:** GitHub PR URL → `owner/repo#N` → `#N`/`N` (resolve the repository) → named branch → auto-find the current branch's PR → LOCAL when no PR is found. Branch discovery uses `corvus_review_pr` op `find`; LOCAL evidence uses op `local`. Missing input is not a stop. Ambiguous candidates use an interactive selection when available, otherwise OPEN first and then greatest PR number, with the choice disclosed.

**LOCAL mode:** review the current worktree's changes against the default-branch merge base, including uncommitted edits. State uses the resolved review root described below: namespace-level `review-input.json` plus `<code_head>/REVIEW_DOCUMENT.md` and `meta.yaml` (`mode: local`, dirty state recorded). The local lock and best-effort history-only/head verdict calls remain; unavailable verdicts are disclosed, with synthesis counts labelled as such. PR identity, repository config, CI checks, prior PR reviews and remote-lock semantics are skipped with notes; built-in defaults plus trusted invocation settings apply. R3 creates no candidate or posting artifact, R4 offers no posting choice, and R5 releases the owned lock and prints the document path or persistence diagnostic and separate axis counts to chat without a writer dispatch. A clean default branch with no PR, no commits ahead and no changes ends with a one-sentence no-work result.

**Review state and layout:** review state is committed by default on the feature branch. `corvus_review_sync` resolves `.corvus/tasks/<task>/reviews/pr<N>/` when the unfiltered changed-file inventory identifies exactly one task, otherwise `.corvus/reviews/pr<N>/`; LOCAL substitutes `local-<branch-slug>` for `pr<N>`. Legacy `<owner>__<repo>__pr<N>` and `local__<repo>__<slug>` roots remain readable through `legacy_root` for one release and are never written again. `.corvus/**` is excluded from review scope. `.corvus/reviews/` must not be gitignored in target repositories or state commits cannot land; keep task-scoped review roots trackable too. `state_sync: false` skips state pull/push, not PR review posting; sync is best-effort, and failures retain local state and never block posting. Fork PR state is never pushed, and LOCAL sync requires an upstream.

**Friction policy:** once R3 synthesis exists, autonomous PR delivery is the default under the [Delivery Principle](skill/corvus-review-extras/SKILL.md#delivery-principle); recoverable gaps proceed with a note and available evidence. A `refuse_delta: true` verdict is retained and disclosed while the requested review proceeds once; only a trusted invocation supplies `force_delta`. Frontmatter defaults to allow; review prompts retain read-only shell discipline, and coordinators may perform small read-only checks directly. Interactive authorization, containment, owned-state writes, the tool-side writer caller check and the post tool's head/artifact checks remain required; recovery never grants missing authority or an alternate posting endpoint. LOCAL never posts, and CLOSED/MERGED at R5 revalidation excludes delivery.

**Token scopes:** `repo` covers reading PRs, diffs and reviews and posting reviews; without suitable repository access, required reads or posting fail (public repositories may use narrower access). `corvus_review_pr` op `identity` owns identity lookup and its 403 fallback; unavailable identity adds an `identity_unknown` notice with `read:user` guidance, not an action cap. `checks:read` (Checks read permission for fine-grained tokens) enables CI verification; without check access, CI is reported unavailable, never assumed passing.

**Notices, not caps:** draft PRs, self-review and unknown authenticated identity produce `state_notices` (`draft_pr`, `self_review`, `identity_unknown`); state notices do not select the event. Action precedence is **Delivery → Coverage caps → Trusted override → Configured action**. The shipped `default_action: COMMENT_ONLY` still selects COMMENT; `auto` derives the event from findings within coverage caps. GitHub can reject an author's own APPROVE/REQUEST_CHANGES; Corvus reports that rejection rather than silently changing the configured action.

### Key Features

- **Two independent axes** — Standards checks repository rules and the Fowler baseline; Spec checks requirements. The security specialist also detects vulnerabilities without a spec. Axis is separate from dimension; four projected `pass_results` slots retain coverage status, while findings are never merged or reranked across axes
- **Dedicated security agent** with OWASP Top 10 and CWE knowledge base
- **Aggressive false-positive filtering** with confidence scores and nit budget enforcement
- **Conventional Comments format** for consistent, actionable feedback
- **Trusted configuration** from `.opencode/review-config.yaml` at the PR's verified immutable base SHA, with safe built-in fallback and visible provenance
- **Delta re-reviews** — a hidden review marker records the reviewed commit; R0 collects prior-review `dispositions`, R1 verifies them against the diff, and both axes use them to skip resolved findings, check prior blockers, and focus on verified changes; unavailable delta evidence falls back to a full review. Posts pin to the reviewed head SHA (`commit_id`) behind a pre-post drift guard
- **Review-role separation** — untrusted PR content is analyzed by R2 reviewers with edit/write denied and read-only prompt obligations; `@code-quality` remains on the implementation-validation path
- **Interactive and autonomous modes** — preview before posting, or let it run hands-free
- **Artifact posting** — R4 freezes `post-request.json`, previews its decoded body/comments, then binds authorization to its SHA-256; R5 sends only the descriptor. The writer checks controls, head, anchors and an existing marker; `corvus_review_post` verifies the artifact internally before its GET and every POST, submitting unchanged file bytes
- **Automatic size fitting** — freeze fits every schema-valid over-budget candidate into a bounded summary with no inline comments, retained marker/notices and per-axis headlines (or a leading-summary anchor), plus exactly one `Review limits: N findings omitted for size` footer. No model size loop or size-based no-post remains; the preview shows the actual fitted artifact and labels the full `REVIEW_DOCUMENT` as local evidence
- **Just-in-time context gathering** — no pre-built index needed, works on any repo

The plugin exposes [seven review tools](docs/CORVUS-REVIEW-SKILL-SET.md#posting-by-artifact); models never edit review-state files. `corvus_review_persist` stages documents, input and candidates via `begin` → `append` → `finalize`. Large candidates split the body and each comment's `path`/`body` losslessly, keeping complete serialized calls ≤6,000 characters including JSON escaping. Candidate staging is independent of document-checkpoint success. `corvus_review_payload` owns `measure`, `freeze` and read-only `preview`; the [fitting contract](skill/corvus-review-extras/state.md#freeze-at-r4) defines `fitted`, `omitted` and the footer count. In-budget canonical bytes stay unchanged.

The writer preflights only `corvus_review_pr` and `corvus_review_post`, then follows descriptor validation → controls/head/anchor reads → marker lookup → post → result mapping. Writer PR reads are limited to `head`/`diff`/`files`/`reviews`. Post resolves workspace-relative artifact paths against the host session directory, not the process cwd; absolute paths still work, with traversal/outside-root/symlink escapes rejected. `artifact-verify-failed:*` maps to writer `not_posted` / `verify: <diagnostic>` and [R4 artifact repair](skill/corvus-review-r4/SKILL.md#artifact-repair): re-stage → measure → freeze → preview → re-authorize. There is no standalone verification call or one-shot re-freeze ritual.

Checkpoint, verdict, metadata and sync calls stay in place as best-effort bookkeeping, never posting prerequisites. Checkpoint failure retains in-memory synthesis for delivery. The [bookkeeping audit](docs/CORVUS-REVIEW-SKILL-SET.md#bookkeeping-and-audit-evidence) accepts consistent evidence or disclosed unavailability, fails undisclosed failures and forged success distinctly, and accepts explicitly labelled synthesis counts when verdict counts are unavailable. Disclosure requires a final assistant note naming the operation and its diagnostic (or explicitly saying no diagnostic exists), including when failure metadata itself could not be written.

Capability failures preserve any complete checkpoint and invocation mode. Say `post` to restart R0, revalidate head/base/config, resume compatible unchanged-head synthesis, and renew measurement, freeze, preview and authorization; interactive posting requires question. Use `@corvus-review-auto` deliberately for question-free posting. A confirmed GitHub POST rejection is reported as such; unknown transport uses [R5 read-only reconciliation](skill/corvus-review-r5/SKILL.md#reconcile-writer-transport), with one additional identical-descriptor writer dispatch only after complete listings prove absence. Missing tool storage or source evidence is disclosed, never repaired with manual writes or invented content.

### Convergence and calibration

Review rounds distinguish document counts from the `converged` verdict and human-approval recommendation; [Convergence and Continuation](skill/corvus-review-extras/SKILL.md#convergence-and-continuation) owns the predicate, optional concise `post_converged_summary` presentation, and proceed-with-note continuation with trusted-only `force_delta` input. Convergence does not suppress delivery or override the event. [Configuration](skill/corvus-review-extras/config.md) owns shared nit/minor totals, [R3](skill/corvus-review-r3/SKILL.md) owns allocation and review-fix/delta polish filtering, and [R2](skill/corvus-review-r2/SKILL.md) owns delta scope and the merge-blocking Fowler baseline. [Finding origin](skill/corvus-review-extras/schemas.md#finding) is lineage evidence, not inferred fix intent; [state](skill/corvus-review-extras/state.md) retains local and posted outcomes without changing invocation mode.

## Upgrading from 0.9 to 0.10

- **Models** — Distinct `task-planner` and `plan-reviewer` models are optional and preferred. Without distinct overrides, review proceeds with a visible same-model degraded warning; see [Cross-model plan review](#cross-model-plan-review-recommended) for both hosts' configuration.
- **Plans** — Legacy `MASTER_PLAN.md` and task files remain read-only. Resume or follow-up runs task-planner's `AMEND_PLAN copy-forward` into a fresh `PLAN.md`, preserving requirements, history and remaining work. Its `DISCOVERY.md` companion persists discovery evidence and environment context; see [amendments](agent/task-planner.md#amend_plan) and [discovery](agent/task-planner.md#discovery-companion).
- **Tests** — Replace the old flags using this mapping:

| 0.9 `tests_enabled` | 0.9 `tests_deferred` | 0.9 `test_scope` | 0.10 `tests` |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------|
| `true` | `true` | Any | `deferred` |
| `false` | Any | Any | `none` |
| `true` | `false` | Any | `deferred` |

The per-phase test run is gone: deferred coverage is authored during implementation and executed at final validation; `none` neither authors nor runs tests. See [Tests policy](skill/corvus-phase-2/SKILL.md#tests).

- **Review** — Finding IDs are `<dim>-<axis>-NNN` (`arch`, `logic`, `conv`, `sec`; `standards` or `spec`). Standards and Spec stay separate through synthesis; see [Convergence and calibration](#convergence-and-calibration) for finding caps and series policy. Posting uses a persisted artifact plus SHA-256, not retyped review text. Prior-review `dispositions` carry evidenced fixed/declined/open/unknown states to both axes; see the [review reference](docs/CORVUS-REVIEW-SKILL-SET.md).
- **Prompt tests** — The byte-pin test is removed. Contributors use [`prompt-budgets.json`](prompt-budgets.json) and [`src/__tests__/prompt-structure.test.ts`](src/__tests__/prompt-structure.test.ts) for budgets and structural contracts, alongside prose review.

See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md#0100-beta0--2026-09-09) for breaking changes and review-round-1 fixes.

## Development

The published package keeps `@opencode-ai/plugin` peer compatibility broad (`*`). Contributor installs pin the development SDK baseline to `@opencode-ai/plugin@1.18.3` so local build and type behavior is reproducible without narrowing consumer compatibility.

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build
bun run build

# Type check
bun x tsc --noEmit

# Run tests (build first; build.test.ts consumes dist/)
bun test
```

### Release Gates

After building, run `bun run smoke:review --host v2`, then `bun run smoke:review --host v1 --full`. This paid, real-model gate packs the working tree, clones PR #8 by default and isolates host state. Posting follows measure → freeze → `preview` → authorization; the gate audits artifact provenance/digests and retains the offline `built verify()` check. By default the writer dispatch is denied by a host permission override; with `--writer` (included in `--full`, v1 only) the real `pr-comment-writer` executes and the gate checks writer dispatch after freeze and post after the writer's head read/marker lookup, with artifact verification internal to `corvus_review_post`. Its exact `POST` must reach the read-only `gh` shim and be blocked, with no shell measurement commands and a non-`posted` result. Bookkeeping uses the evidence-precedence audit, not checkpoint success as a delivery gate; fitted artifacts add the conditional `size fit` row. A valid frozen artifact may remain inert on the writer-not-exposed route without authorizing dispatch or POST.

It uses Bedrock/GitHub authentication without logging credentials; the shim blocks posting through that route, not arbitrary network clients. Options: `--pr <url>`, `--model <id>` (default `amazon-bedrock/global.openai.gpt-6-astra`), `--timeout-min <minutes>` (default 40), `--writer`/`--full`, and `--keep`. `bash scripts/smoke-writer.sh` runs only the writer against canned PR reads (no network) for a fast tool-path check with a review body longer than the host read tool's 2,000-character line limit; `--head-moved` moves the canned head after the writer's own check so the gate asserts the post tool's `head-moved` rejection with no POST issued. Failures always retain logs/artifacts and private sandbox auth; do not upload the whole sandbox. Exit codes: 0 pass, 3 host/plugin/auth, 4 fixture/GitHub read, 5 incomplete review/unexpected denial, 6 posting barrier breach, 124 timeout.

### Safe Local Development

- Treat `.opencode/opencode.jsonc` in a checkout as developer-local OpenCode state. Do not overwrite, copy into the package, commit, or use it as an implicit product input when developing Corvus.
- Product inputs are the checked-in `agent/`, `command/`, and `skill/` prompts plus the plugin source. Manual-install experiments should copy or link only those prompt directories after inspecting the destination.
- Keep local OpenCode configuration changes explicit and separate from source changes. Your configuration is applied last on both hosts, so local hardening does not need to be copied into Corvus defaults.

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not loading** — Check the plugin entry in your OpenCode config (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, or a project-local `.opencode/opencode.json`). Both hosts expect an ARRAY of package specifiers rather than a boolean map: v1 reads `"plugin": ["corvus-ai"]` and v2 reads `"plugins": ["corvus-ai@beta"]`.

**Agents not appearing** — Make sure `bun install` or `npm install` completed successfully. The package must be present in `node_modules` with its `agent/`, `command/`, and `skill/` directories.

**Skills not found** — Skills are loaded from the package's `skill/` directory at runtime. If you used the manual install method, verify your symlinks point to the correct location (`ls -la ~/.config/opencode/skill/`).

**Duplicate agents** — If you have both the plugin install and manual symlinks active, agents may appear twice. Pick one installation method and remove the other.
